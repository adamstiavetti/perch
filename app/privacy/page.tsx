            <h2>What we collect</h2>
            <p>
              jmpseat collects the email address you submit through the public
              waitlist.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you choose to answer the optional follow-up survey, jmpseat may
              collect general information about your aviation connection,
              base or airport priorities, desired features, current tools or
              communities, beta interest, how you heard about jmpseat, and
              privacy or trust concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
              jmpseat may also collect basic source and attribution information,
              such as landing path and campaign parameters, to understand where
              waitlist interest is coming from.
            </p>
            <p>
              After you join the waitlist, jmpseat may set a limited cookie or
              token in your browser so optional survey answers can be attached
              to the waitlist signup you already submitted. This cookie is not a
              login credential and does not grant beta access.

            <h2>How we use it</h2>
            <p>
              We use waitlist information to manage the waitlist, send jmpseat
              updates, understand demand for bases, layovers, lounges, and
              access features, prioritize early product direction, and decide
              which communities to support first.

            <p>
              The public waitlist does not ask for employee IDs, badge or proof
              uploads, documents, schedules, exact hotel information, portal
              credentials, passenger information, live location, or confidential
              company information.

            <h2>Service providers</h2>
            <p>
              jmpseat may use service providers for hosting, database storage,
              email delivery, security, and similar operations needed to run the
              waitlist. Those providers are used to operate jmpseat, not to sell
              waitlist information.
            </p>
            <p>
              jmpseat may also disclose information if required by law, to
              protect the service, or to respond to abuse, security, or safety
              issues.

            <h2>Retention</h2>
            <p>
              jmpseat keeps waitlist information while it is needed for
              waitlist management, product planning, launch communications,
              security, or legal reasons. We may delete or de-identify waitlist
              information when it is no longer needed.
