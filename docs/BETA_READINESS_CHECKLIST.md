# Beta Readiness Checklist

Brand note: jmpseat is the canonical product and app name. This document does not claim legal or trademark clearance for the name.

Product principle: Utility first. Community second. Social feed last.

Identity principle: Verified privately. Anonymous publicly. Accountable internally.

This checklist translates the current planning docs into concrete pre-beta gates. It is documentation-only and does not create or require app code in this repository.

Current scope note:

- This checklist remains the broader/full private-beta target reference.
- It should not be read as the immediate post-Epoch-5 implementation lane.
- Use `docs/ops/private-beta-readiness-bridge.md` for the current narrow bridge
  between the closed Epoch 5 baseline and broader `05B / Community Access
  Architecture` work.
- Use `docs/ops/05b-first-base-mvp-planning.md` for the controlling narrow
  first-05B implementation sequence.
- Current private beta / 05B direction does not use proof uploads. Work-email
  verification and private beta access gates are the active verification path.
  If manual-proof or document-upload workflows are ever reactivated, they need
  a fresh scope decision plus privacy/security review before runtime work.
- DFW is the first launch base and DFW Base Board is the first available base
  board. DFW is not the whole product concept; the data model should support
  many bases, base boards, layover boards, Verified Lounges / restricted
  role-based spaces, follows, posts, comments, saves, reactions/useful marks,
  and access-aware search over time.
- For the first implementation sequence, keep proof uploads, manual
  proof/document uploads, generic social-feed work, generic global Crew Rooms
  expansion, media/upload posting, AI auto-publishing, deals, full mobile scope,
  and anonymous posting unless separately approved out of scope.
- Post-DFW-Hub-baseline audit: `docs/ops/private-beta-policy-ops-readiness-audit.md`
  is the current focused readiness audit after DFW Today, DFW Base, DFW
  Layover, Channels create/read, and T26E-A channel post reporting/moderation
  foundation were implemented, beta-smoked, and documented. Treat the matrix in
  that audit as the immediate private-beta policy/ops gap list before inviting
  more users.
- Policy/Ops Pack v1: `docs/ops/policy-ops-pack-v1-summary.md` creates the
  first complete private-beta policy/copy/runbook draft set. It helps satisfy
  the draft-copy and operating-rule gap from the audit, but it is not wired
  into app routes, onboarding, posting, reporting, footer links, or policy
  acceptance, and it still needs founder/legal review before broad launch.
- Policy/Ops Pack v1 UI wiring:
  `docs/ops/policy-ops-pack-v1-ui-wiring.md` adds read-only private-beta policy
  pages and focused links from public/auth/access-hold/Channels/admin surfaces.
  This does not add legal acceptance tracking, support/deletion/export/appeal
  intake, final approved contact paths, or final legal approval. Browser smoke
  is needed after deployment.

## How to Use This Checklist

- Private beta means a small, controlled group of real users with admin coverage and manual operations.
- Public launch means broader availability beyond the controlled private beta.
- Any unchecked "Required for private beta" item is a launch blocker unless the founder explicitly accepts the risk in writing.
- Any item marked "Required before public launch" may be deferred from private beta only if the deferral is documented.

Required for private beta:

- [ ] Tier 0: unverified / waitlist is documented.
- [ ] Tier 1: basic email verified is documented.
- [ ] Tier 2: aviation work email verified is documented.

      review remains out of current scope unless separately reactivated.
- [ ] Tier 4: peer-vouched by verified members is documented as gated/supplemental.
- [ ] Tier 5: employment/payroll/API verified later is documented as later-stage only.
- [ ] V1 supports only practical verification paths: basic email, aviation work email where available, and manual review.
- [ ] Manual verification review workflow exists for the active non-upload path.
- [ ] Admin verification dashboard exists or private beta has a documented manual admin process.

- [ ] Secret scan has no unresolved findings.
- [ ] Security review has no unaccepted high/critical findings.
- [ ] Incident response plan exists for credential leak, verification artifact exposure, passenger-data exposure, and emergency safety/security escalation.

## 8. Upload Security Gate

Verification uploads are sensitive and should not be accepted until file handling is safe enough for real user documents.

Current status:

- Proof uploads are deprecated/out of current scope for the current private
  beta / 05B path.
- The checklist below is preserved as a future-gate reference only. It is not
  an active prerequisite before 05B.
- Existing proof-upload code/storage/artifacts, if still present, remain subject
  to these privacy/security expectations until removed or retired through a
  reviewed plan.

Required for private beta:

- [ ] Verification uploads enforce allowed file types.
- [ ] Verification uploads enforce size limits.
- [ ] Verification uploads validate content type.
- [ ] Verification uploads validate file signatures where practical.
- [ ] Verification uploads use private storage only.
- [ ] Uploaded files are renamed on storage.
- [ ] Uploaded files are not served from public paths.
- [ ] Uploaded files use short-lived admin links.
- [ ] Uploaded file access is logged.

- [ ] No AI processing of verification documents in V1.

Required before public launch:

- [ ] Malware scanning decision is implemented or explicitly accepted with risk owner.
- [ ] Upload rejection events are logged as SecurityEvents.
- [ ] Retention/deletion automation exists or a manual process is documented and tested.

## 9. Accessibility Gate

The beta should be usable by keyboard and assistive technology users across core flows.

Required for private beta:

- [ ] WCAG 2.2 AA is the target.
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works across auth.

- [ ] UploadArtifact is accounted for only as historical/future conditional
      scope, not as part of the current private beta / 05B path.
- [ ] Subscription is explicitly deferred because V1 does not include payments.
- [ ] AuditLog is accounted for either as a distinct entity or explicitly covered by SecurityEvent, ModerationAction, and verification decision history.
- [ ] Sensitive entities have privacy/security notes: User, Profile, Verification, TrustLevel, Report, ModerationAction, AIBrief, SecurityEvent, UploadArtifact.
- [ ] The model does not include airline portal credentials.
- [ ] The model does not include scraped schedules.
- [ ] The model does not include live crew location records.
- [ ] The model does not include flight-load request infrastructure.
- [ ] The model does not include roster/calendar integrations.

Required before public launch:

- [ ] Data retention fields are reviewed and tested.
- [ ] Audit trail coverage is reviewed for verification, moderation, admin, and
      AI safety events; upload audit review is required only if upload workflows
      are reactivated.

- [ ] Vendor complaint/removal process is documented.
- [ ] Payment processing is not enabled until Stripe/payment security planning is complete.

## 12. Beta Launch Gate

Beta should launch only when the product is controlled, observable, reversible, and adequately moderated.

Minimum readiness criteria:

- [ ] At least two admin users are configured.
- [ ] Admin access uses stronger controls than ordinary users.
- [ ] Moderation coverage schedule is defined for private beta.
- [ ] Emergency escalation owner is defined.
- [ ] Verification review owner is defined.
- [ ] Seed content exists for initial Crew Rooms.
- [ ] Seed content exists for initial Base Boards.
- [ ] Seed content exists for initial Layover Boards.
- [ ] Initial NonRev Deals entries are reviewed.
- [ ] Test users cover unverified, email verified, pending verification, verified, restricted, suspended, and admin states.
- [ ] Verification testing covers work email path.
- [ ] Verification testing covers manual review path if manual uploads are enabled.
- [ ] Reporting and moderation have been tested end to end.
- [ ] Jumpseat Brief has been tested against banned categories.
- [ ] Security review is completed.
- [ ] Accessibility review is completed.
- [ ] Privacy review is completed.
- [ ] Rollback plan is documented.

- [ ] Known limitations are documented for beta users.

Do not launch beta if:

- [ ] Verification artifacts are accepted without a retention/deletion policy.
- [ ] Verification artifacts are publicly accessible.
- [ ] Admin verification review is unavailable.
- [ ] Reporting or moderation queue is unavailable.
- [ ] Emergency escalation category is missing.
- [ ] Anonymous posting cannot be tied to an internal account for enforcement.
- [ ] RLS/server-side authorization has not been tested.
- [ ] AI can approve verification or issue final bans.
- [ ] Jumpseat Brief can output exact crew hotel exposure, passenger private information, airport security procedures, or live operations-sensitive information.
- [ ] V1 includes airline portal login, schedule scraping, public nearby crew tracking, dating/swiping, flight-load requests, native mobile, full marketplace payments, advanced employment verification APIs, or roster/calendar integrations.
- [ ] Legal/trademark status is represented as cleared.

## 13. Open Questions Before Beta

These decisions must be answered before real users are invited.

- [ ] What is the exact verification-document retention period?
- [ ] Confirm private beta remains limited to work email/private-access gates
      and non-upload review. Any future manual badge/document upload workflow
      requires a fresh scope decision plus privacy/security review.
- [ ] What is the target first base/community?
- [ ] What is the initial ambassador strategy?
- [ ] Who are the first 50 beta users?
- [ ] What is the legal/trademark clearance path for the jmpseat working name?
- [ ] Who drafts privacy policy and terms of service?
- [ ] Are crash pad listings excluded from V1 and held for Phase 2, or included only as discussion without listings/payments?
- [ ] Who owns emergency escalation during private beta?
- [ ] What are the admin response-time expectations for verification and reports?
- [ ] What exact content is seeded before beta?
