# Build Tickets

Brand note: jmpseat is the canonical product and app name. This document does not claim legal or trademark clearance for the name.
Rename note: Deadhead Club is retired and should not be used in current docs, UI, code, or planning. Older Git history may still contain legacy references.

This is a prioritized implementation plan for a future build phase. No app code is included in this documentation-only repository initialization.

Labels used: docs, product, foundation, auth, verification, community, moderation, AI, monetization, admin, later.

Current controlling docs for Hub work:

- [Product Delivery Operating Model](PRODUCT_DELIVERY_OPERATING_MODEL.md) -
  includes the permanent Documentation Governance for Feature Tickets rule:
  feature work must identify affected docs, final reports must state docs
  updated/not updated, reviews must check controlling-doc alignment, and product
  pivots or MVP/deferred-boundary changes must update checkpoint/backlog docs.
- [Hub Pivot Plan](ops/hub-pivot-plan.md) - approved post-T20 Hub product model
  and naming.
- [FBMVP-T21 DFW Hub Product Framing Runtime Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t21-dfw-hub-product-framing-runtime-smoke.md) - manual beta UI smoke for the
  T21 DFW Hub shell and expected UX debt.
- [FBMVP-T22 Hub Channels IA / Data Model Lock](ops/fbmvp-t22-hub-channels-ia-data-model-lock.md) - current source of truth for real Hub
  Channels: reuse/extend `public.boards` as child channel boards, preserve
  T12-T20 primitives, and do not create a standalone `channels` table yet.
- [FBMVP-T23A Full Mobile Hub Wireframes](ops/fbmvp-t23a-full-mobile-hub-wireframes.md) - mobile-first design packet for Home, DFW Hub,
  DFW Today, Base, Layover, Channels, Channel detail, Thread detail, Start a
  Thread, replies, reports, saved/empty states, and bottom navigation. Visual
  mockup direction is approved with required revisions before prototyping:
  compact rows for repeated Channels/threads/comments, beta-safe placeholders,
  consistent Home/Hubs/Search/Saved/Me nav, and Request a Channel kept
  secondary.
- `FBMVP-T23B Protected Static Hub Wireframe Prototype Route` - locally
  implemented admin-only static review route at
  `/app/admin/design/dfw-hub-wireframes`, using fake/mock/static data only and
  no Supabase content RPCs, runtime UGC, DB/RPC-backed Channels, migrations, or
  runtime mutation.
- [FBMVP-T23B Static Wireframe Prototype Manual Review](ops/fbmvp-t23b-static-wireframe-prototype-manual-review.md) - records manual beta
  visual review of `/app/admin/design/dfw-hub-wireframes` at
  `07ebf7b fix: polish hub wireframe prototype`. Decision: approved with
  future UI polish. No functionality blocker remains, so the next work should
  move into narrow Home / DFW Hub implementation planning rather than more
  prototype polishing.
- [FBMVP-T24A Real Home + DFW Hub Visual Refresh](ops/fbmvp-t24a-real-home-dfw-hub-visual-refresh.md) - local implementation note for the
  narrow production Home/dashboard and real DFW Hub overview visual refresh,
  using the approved post-Hub-pivot direction while preserving existing access
  gates, safe data paths, internal Baseboard primitives, and the deferred
  DB/RPC-backed Channels scope.
- [FBMVP-T24A Real Home + DFW Hub Runtime Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t24a-real-home-dfw-hub-runtime-smoke.md) - records deployed beta/manual browser
  review of `12df45b` on `beta.jmpseat.com` for `/app` and `/app/hubs/dfw`.
  Decision: runtime smoke passed with non-blocking visual polish, no
  functionality blocker, and no need for further T24A implementation patches
  before moving forward.
- [FBMVP-T25B Hub Channel Board Type + DFW Seeds](ops/fbmvp-t25b-hub-channel-board-type-dfw-seeds.md) - local schema/seed foundation for
  `hub_channel` plus six DFW child board rows under the existing DFW parent
  `base_board`. These are private-beta seed defaults, not final release
  taxonomy. It adds no UI routes, channel RPCs, post reads, composer, comments,
  reports, moderation review changes, broad database push, or deploy.
- [FBMVP-T25B Hub Channel Board Type + DFW Seeds Runtime Apply](ops/fbmvp-t25b-hub-channel-board-type-dfw-seeds-runtime-apply.md) - records targeted runtime
  application of `20260611183000 create_hub_channel_board_type_dfw_seeds` to the
  intended `jmpseat` Supabase project. The runtime now has the `hub_channel`
  board type and six DFW child channel boards, with no UI routes, channel
  post/list/create/detail RPCs, composer changes, comments, reports, moderation
  review changes, broad database push, deploy, or app code changes.
- [FBMVP-T26A Hub Channel List Read + DFW Channels Overview](ops/fbmvp-t26a-hub-channel-list-read-route.md) - local implementation note for the first real
  Channels read slice: a safe `list_open_hub_channels(p_base_code)` metadata RPC,
  a server helper, and `/app/hubs/dfw/channels`. It adds no channel post
  list/read/create/detail behavior, composer, comments, reports, moderation
  review changes, request/create workflow, broad database push, or deploy.
- [FBMVP-T26A Hub Channel List Read Runtime Apply](ops/fbmvp-t26a-hub-channel-list-read-route-runtime-apply.md) - records targeted runtime
  application of `20260611203000 create_hub_channel_list_read_rpc` to the
  intended `jmpseat` Supabase project. The runtime now has
  `public.list_open_hub_channels(p_base_code text)`, with no channel post
  behavior, composer, comments, reports, moderation review changes,
  request/create workflow, broad database push, migration repair,
  `apply_migration`, deploy, or app code changes during the apply.
- [FBMVP-T26A DFW Channels Authenticated Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t26a-dfw-channels-authenticated-browser-smoke.md) - records authenticated
  beta browser smoke for `https://beta.jmpseat.com/app/hubs/dfw/channels`.
  The route rendered the six runtime-backed DFW channel rows with no
  unavailable/error state, preserved the static secondary Request a Channel
  boundary, and exposed no posts, composer, comments, report/moderation
  controls, IDs, or runtime content. The pass is functional only; significant
  UI/UX polish remains deferred and should not block T26B.
- [FBMVP-T26B Channel Thread-List Read Foundation](ops/fbmvp-t26b-channel-thread-list-read-foundation.md) - local implementation note for
  the first selected-channel read slice: a safe
  `list_open_hub_channel_posts(p_base_code, p_channel_slug, p_limit)` RPC,
  server helper, and protected `/app/hubs/dfw/channels/[channelSlug]` route.
  It reads published posts by `board_posts.board_id` on the resolved
  `hub_channel` board, not by `board_posts.category`, and adds no composer,
  post creation, post detail, comments, reports, moderation review changes,
  Request a Channel workflow, broad database push, or deploy.
- [FBMVP-T26B Channel Thread-List Read Runtime Apply](ops/fbmvp-t26b-channel-thread-list-read-foundation-runtime-apply.md) - records the targeted runtime
  apply pass for the T26B selected-channel post-list RPC. Runtime now has
  `public.list_open_hub_channel_posts(p_base_code text, p_channel_slug text, p_limit integer)`.
  The apply used targeted SQL execution in one explicit transaction, added only
  ledger row `20260611214500 create_hub_channel_post_list_rpc`, and did not use
  broad database push, migration repair, `apply_migration`, deploy, app code
  changes, staging, or commit.
- [FBMVP-T26B Selected Channel Authenticated Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t26b-selected-channel-authenticated-browser-smoke.md) - records functional
  beta browser smoke for `/app/hubs/dfw/channels/[channelSlug]`. Authenticated
  eligible access reached `dfw-q-and-a` and `commuting-parking`, safe empty
  states rendered where no channel posts exist, overview row navigation worked,
  anonymous beta access redirected to login, public apex did not expose the
  private route, and no composer, Start a Thread, comments, reports,
  moderation controls, fake counts, IDs, proof/storage fields, or runtime
  comments/reports were exposed. UI/UX polish remains deferred.
- [FBMVP-T26C Channel Post Detail Read Foundation](ops/fbmvp-t26c-channel-post-detail-read-foundation.md) - local implementation note for
  the selected-channel post detail read slice: a safe
  `get_open_hub_channel_post(p_base_code, p_channel_slug, p_post_id)` RPC,
  server helper, protected `/app/hubs/dfw/channels/[channelSlug]/[postId]`
  route, and links from selected-channel thread-list rows into detail routes.
  It reads a published post by `board_posts.board_id` on the resolved
  `hub_channel` board, not by `board_posts.category`, and adds no composer,
  post creation, comments, reports, moderation review changes, Request a
  Channel workflow, broad database push, or deploy.
- [FBMVP-T26C Channel Post Detail Read Runtime Apply](ops/fbmvp-t26c-channel-post-detail-read-foundation-runtime-apply.md) - records the targeted runtime
  apply pass for the T26C selected-channel post-detail RPC. Runtime now has
  `public.get_open_hub_channel_post(p_base_code text, p_channel_slug text, p_post_id uuid)`.
  The apply used a targeted SQL transaction, added only ledger row
  `20260612024544 create_hub_channel_post_detail_rpc`, and did not use broad
  database push, migration repair, `apply_migration`, deploy, Vercel changes,
  app code changes, staging, or commit. Authenticated browser/route smoke is
  still pending and may require a safe post on a child `hub_channel` board.
- [FBMVP-T26C Channel Post Detail Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t26c-channel-post-detail-browser-smoke.md) - records partial authenticated
  beta browser smoke for `/app/hubs/dfw/channels/[channelSlug]/[postId]`.
  Candidate discovery found no published child-channel posts, so happy-path
  post rendering and row-click navigation were not claimed. The synthetic
  `dfw-q-and-a` detail route rendered the T26C unavailable-state shell for an
  authenticated beta session, no-cookie beta access redirected to login, public
  apex did not expose the private route, and product/security boundaries held.
- [FBMVP-T26D Channel Composer / Create Post Foundation](ops/fbmvp-t26d-channel-composer-create-foundation.md) - locally adds the selected-channel
  composer/create-post foundation: a safe
  `create_open_hub_channel_post(p_base_code, p_channel_slug, p_title, p_body, p_content_type, p_category)`
  RPC, a server action, and a title/body composer on
  `/app/hubs/dfw/channels/[channelSlug]`. It resolves the selected
  `hub_channel` board server-side by base code and channel slug, inserts with
  `board_posts.board_id`, does not use `board_posts.category` as channel
  membership, and redirects successful submissions to the selected-channel post
  detail route. Runtime apply is recorded separately; failed/partial browser
  smoke is recorded separately. It adds no
  comments, reports, moderation review changes, Request a Channel workflow,
  DFW Today/Base/Layover baselines, broad database push, or deploy.
- [FBMVP-T26D Channel Composer / Create Post Runtime Apply](ops/fbmvp-t26d-channel-composer-create-foundation-runtime-apply.md) - records targeted
  runtime apply for the selected-channel create-post RPC. Runtime now has
  `public.create_open_hub_channel_post(p_base_code text, p_channel_slug text, p_title text, p_body text, p_content_type text, p_category text)`.
  The apply used targeted SQL execution only, added only ledger row
  `20260612044500 create_hub_channel_post_create_rpc`, and did not use broad
  database push, migration repair, `apply_migration`, deploy, Vercel changes,
  app code changes, staging, or commit. Authenticated browser/create smoke
  is recorded separately.
- [FBMVP-T26D Channel Composer Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t26d-channel-composer-browser-smoke.md) - records failed/partial authenticated beta browser
  smoke for the selected-channel composer. Exactly one safe post was created in
  `dfw-q-and-a`; the thread list rendered it, but the create flow returned
  `?post=dfw_channel_post_failed` instead of redirecting to detail, and direct
  detail navigation rendered a safe unavailable state. No more smoke posts
  should be created until the create/action return handling and T26C detail-read
  mismatch are investigated. Product, access, public-domain, and privacy
  boundaries held.
- [FBMVP-T26D Channel Composer UUID Validation Fix](ops/fbmvp-t26d-channel-composer-uuid-validation-fix.md) - records the local app-side fix for
  the failed/partial T26D/T26C smoke. The root cause was malformed selected
  channel UUID validation, not runtime SQL. The fix shares the existing
  five-group UUID pattern across create/detail helpers, needs no runtime
  migration, and should reuse the existing safe smoke post for browser re-smoke
  after deployment.
- [FBMVP-T26D/T26C Post-Fix Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t26d-t26c-post-fix-browser-smoke.md) - records authenticated beta browser smoke after
  `dfbdc79`. The existing safe `dfw-q-and-a` smoke post rendered in both the
  selected-channel thread list and selected-channel post detail route, so T26B
  list and T26C detail happy paths passed post-fix. No new post was created;
  T26D full create-browser redirect remains untested unless another safe post
  is explicitly authorized.
- [FBMVP-T26D Final Create Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t26d-final-create-browser-smoke.md) - records the authorized final T26D create-browser
  smoke after the UUID validation fix. Exactly one additional safe `dfw-q-and-a`
  post was created and list/detail reads passed, but the browser stayed on the
  selected-channel page instead of redirecting to the new detail route. T26D
  remains partial/fail pending post-submit navigation/redirect investigation.
- [FBMVP-T26D Channel Composer Redirect Fix](ops/fbmvp-t26d-channel-composer-redirect-fix.md) - records the local app-side navigation fix for
  the remaining create redirect defect. Runtime SQL is not implicated: the
  action now returns a narrow safe created `href`, and the selected-channel
  composer uses client-side success navigation to push that detail route.
  Runtime migration/apply docs are not needed.
- [FBMVP-T26D Final Create Redirect Browser Smoke Pass](ops/fbmvp-t26d-final-create-redirect-browser-smoke-pass.md) - records the successful
  authenticated beta browser smoke after `82f4399`. Exactly one additional safe
  `dfw-q-and-a` post was created, the browser redirected directly to the new
  selected-channel post detail route, T26B list and T26C detail regressions
  passed, and product/security/public-domain boundaries held. T26D create
  redirect can be considered closed after this docs record is reviewed and
  committed. UI/UX polish remains deferred.
- [FBMVP-T27A DFW Today Lightweight Baseline](ops/fbmvp-t27a-dfw-today-lightweight-baseline.md) - locally adds the protected read-only
  `/app/hubs/dfw/today` route with static/config-backed quick checks, curated
  utility cards, safety boundary copy, and safe links into existing DFW
  Channels. It adds no migration, runtime mutation, live operations data,
  external integration, AI, posting, comments, reports, moderation controls,
  Request a Channel workflow, broad database push, or deploy.
- [FBMVP-T27A DFW Today Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t27a-dfw-today-browser-smoke.md) - records authenticated beta browser smoke for
  `/app/hubs/dfw/today` after `de92bab`. The route rendered DFW Today, quick
  checks, utility cards, safety boundary copy, and safe channel cross-links;
  no-cookie beta/public-domain boundaries held; no live ops-sensitive data,
  AI, posting, comments, reports, moderation controls, Request a Channel
  workflow, IDs, proof data, storage paths, or signed URLs were exposed.
- [FBMVP-T27B DFW Base Lightweight Baseline](ops/fbmvp-t27b-dfw-base-lightweight-baseline.md) - locally adds the protected read-only
  `/app/hubs/dfw/base` route with static DFW Base orientation content, base
  essentials, useful next links, safety boundary copy, and links into existing
  DFW Channels and DFW Today. It adds no migration, runtime mutation, live
  operations data, external integration, AI, posting, comments, reports,
  moderation controls, Request a Channel workflow, broad database push, or
  deploy.
- [FBMVP-T27B DFW Base Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t27b-dfw-base-browser-smoke.md) - records authenticated beta browser smoke for
  `/app/hubs/dfw/base` after `6d64546`. The route rendered DFW Base,
  start-here guidance, base essentials, useful next links, safety boundary
  copy, and safe channel/utility cross-links; no-cookie beta/public-domain
  boundaries held; no live ops-sensitive data, AI, posting, comments, reports,
  moderation controls, Request a Channel workflow, Baseboard label, IDs, proof
  data, storage paths, signed URLs, or UUID-like internal IDs were exposed.
- [FBMVP-T27C DFW Layover Lightweight Baseline](ops/fbmvp-t27c-dfw-layover-lightweight-baseline.md) - locally adds the protected read-only
  `/app/hubs/dfw/layover` route with static DFW Layover planning reminders,
  layover essentials, useful next links, safety boundary copy, and links into
  existing DFW Channels, DFW Today, and DFW Base. It adds no migration, runtime
  mutation, exact crew hotel exposure, live crew location, live operations data,
  external integration, AI, posting, comments, reports, moderation controls,
  Request a Channel workflow, broad database push, or deploy.
- [FBMVP-T27C DFW Layover Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t27c-dfw-layover-browser-smoke.md) - records authenticated beta browser smoke for
  `/app/hubs/dfw/layover` after `604bf31`. The route rendered DFW Layover,
  start-here guidance, layover essentials, useful next links, safety boundary
  copy, private-beta/static future copy, and safe channel/utility cross-links;
  no-cookie beta/public-domain boundaries held; no exact crew hotel details,
  live crew location, live operations data, AI, posting, comments, reports,
  moderation controls, Request a Channel workflow, Baseboard label, IDs, proof
  data, storage paths, signed URLs, or UUID-like internal IDs were exposed.
- [FBMVP Checkpoint: DFW Hub Baseline Pillars Complete](ops/fbmvp-checkpoint-dfw-hub-baseline-pillars-complete.md) - docs-only
  checkpoint at `a55a334` recording that DFW Today, DFW Base, DFW Layover, and
  Channels are complete at lightweight MVP baseline level. It keeps T26E
  comments/reporting/moderation integration, Request a Channel, UI/UX polish,
  and private-beta policy/ops readiness visible as separate remaining lanes.
- [FBMVP-T26E-A Channel Post Reporting + Moderation Review Foundation](ops/fbmvp-t26e-a-channel-post-reporting-moderation-foundation.md) - local
  implementation note for the first selected-channel post safety layer. It
  reuses `public.board_post_reports`, adds channel-scoped reporting/list/review
  RPCs, wires a report affordance on selected-channel post detail, and extends
  `/app/admin/community-moderation` for DFW Channel reports. Targeted runtime
  apply is recorded in
  [FBMVP-T26E-A Channel Post Reporting Runtime Apply](ops/fbmvp-t26e-a-channel-post-reporting-runtime-apply.md);
  partial browser smoke is recorded in
  [FBMVP-T26E-A Channel Post Reporting Partial Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t26e-a-channel-post-reporting-partial-browser-smoke.md).
  User-side report submission, duplicate-safe handling, no-cookie/public-domain
  boundaries, and non-operator admin denial passed. Final operator-scoped
  browser smoke is recorded in
  [FBMVP-T26E-A Channel Post Reporting Final Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t26e-a-channel-post-reporting-final-browser-smoke.md);
  the DFW Channel report review surface rendered with safe context and narrow
  hide/remove actions, neither destructive action was clicked, and the temporary
  moderation scope was restored. Comments, AI decisions, account bans, public
  reporter identity, public report counts, Request a Channel, live integrations,
  payments, and marketplace behavior remain out of scope.
- [Private-Beta Policy / Ops Readiness Audit](ops/private-beta-policy-ops-readiness-audit.md) - docs-only audit after the DFW Hub baseline pillars and
  T26E-A reporting/moderation foundation were completed and smoked. It records
  that DFW Today/Base/Layover plus Channels create/read/report/moderation
  foundation are functionally ready at lightweight MVP level, but broader
  private-beta use still needs beta terms/privacy/community-rules copy,
  work-email verification consent copy, support/contact routing,
  incident/escalation ownership, moderation/appeals runbooks,
  deletion/export request process, and token/access hygiene review before
  inviting more users.
- [FBMVP Checkpoint: DFW Hub + Channels Foundation Level-Set](ops/fbmvp-checkpoint-dfw-hub-channels-foundation-level-set.md) - docs-only
  checkpoint at `0249e0d` after T26A runtime apply docs. It records the current
  completed DFW Hub + Channels metadata foundation and the sequence before
  T26B. A later smoke record confirms authenticated
  `/app/hubs/dfw/channels` functional route smoke passed with UI/UX polish
  deferred.
- [FBMVP Remaining Functional Backlog](ops/fbmvp-remaining-functional-backlog.md) - docs-only
  backlog from checkpoint `c2bbd73` to narrow private-beta MVP. It clarifies
  that Channels are not the entire MVP and records the four DFW utility pillars:
  DFW Today, Base, Layover, and Channels.

Wireframe source pack:

- Current product language: `[AIRPORT] Hub`, `[AIRPORT] Today`, Base, Layover,
  Channels, Recent Useful Threads, and Request a Channel inside Channels.
- DFW private-beta channel seed defaults: DFW Q&A, Commuting & Parking,
  Terminal & Ground Logistics, Food, Coffee & Breaks, New to DFW, and DFW
  Layover & Local. This taxonomy may change before release and before
  meaningful production UGC exists.
- Current UX debt: placeholder-heavy shell, card stacking needs polish,
  Channels needs thread creation/reading/reply hierarchy, and Request a Channel
  should become a secondary action.
- Do not design around real UGC yet. None exists in production.

- [Airline Email Access Gate Decision](strategy/airline-email-access-gate-decision.md) - defines private-testing, first-base launch, and long-term app access gates for confirmed approved airline employee email.
- [Board / Community Access Model Decision](strategy/board-community-access-model-decision.md) - defines general baseboards, restricted boards, board memberships, access requests, and community-admin authority.
- [Proof-System Freeze / Deprecation Plan](strategy/proof-system-freeze-deprecation-plan.md) - freezes proof upload as a forward product path while preserving legacy cleanup, audit, and data-retirement safety.
- [First-Base MVP Scope](strategy/first-base-mvp-scope.md) - defines the first complete base launch package, including airline-email access, boards, posting/Q&A, moderation expectations, trust copy, and launch boundaries.
- [Base Board Product Definition](strategy/base-board-product-definition.md) - canonical definition of a Base Board as the main verified hub/container for an aviation base, combining structured base intel, posts/comments, useful/trending knowledge, related Layover Boards, and restricted Verified Lounges while preserving safety boundaries and T05 model validity.
- [Home Base And Board Follow Decision](strategy/home-base-board-follow-decision.md) - canonical T06 product decision that Home Base is optional personalization state in the initial DFW-only rollout, not authorization truth; setting Home Base auto-follows the matching Base Board; users may follow many boards; follows and self-declared profile fields do not grant restricted-board access.
- [Home Dashboard Product Definition](strategy/home-dashboard-product-definition.md) - canonical definition of the first private-app Home Dashboard as a utility dashboard, not a generic feed, with persistent search followed by Home Base, Crew Picks, Following, Your Lounges, and Saved.
- [Verified Lounge Access Model](strategy/verified-lounge-access-model.md) - canonical definition for restricted lounge access before `FBMVP-T07`, including request lifecycle, Crew Lead scope, request-thread limits, privacy boundaries, and the rule that Home Base, board follows, and self-declared profile fields do not grant lounge access.
- [Hub / Board Taxonomy](strategy/hub-board-taxonomy.md) - canonical product taxonomy that defines Hubs as top-level airport/location containers and defines product-facing Baseboard, Layovers, Lounges, and Crew Picks surfaces, including the MVP seeded Layovers strategy for common DFW crew destinations.
- [Seeded Layovers Editorial Model](strategy/seeded-layovers-editorial-model.md) - canonical editorial and product definition for Seeded Layovers as utility-first bridge content, including Featured Picks/Categories/Crew Notes/Questions structure, AI-review boundaries, Tier 1 destinations, safety rules, and graduation path to future full Hubs.
- [Community Admin Responsibilities / Disclaimer Policy](strategy/community-admin-responsibilities-disclaimer-policy.md) - defines board-scoped community-admin responsibilities, limits, privacy boundaries, non-sponsorship disclaimers, abuse controls, and escalation expectations.
- [Launch-Readiness Gate Transition Plan](strategy/launch-readiness-gate-transition-plan.md) - defines the explicit transition from private-testing beta gates to first-base launch gates without removing beta too early, requiring one-by-one beta grants, or bypassing airline-email verification.
- [Beta Invite-Code Foundation Decision](strategy/beta-invite-code-foundation-decision.md) - defines batch-generated, single-use beta invite codes as private-testing capacity control that must not bypass airline-email verification or become a first-base launch requirement.
- [05B First-Base MVP Planning](ops/05b-first-base-mvp-planning.md) - controlling narrow-lane planning note for the current 05B implementation start; use this doc so older broad beta/V1 planning does not pull the first slice too wide.
- [FBMVP-T05 Base Board Runtime Pass](ops/fbmvp-t05-base-board-runtime-pass.md) - records targeted runtime application of `20260609020355 create_base_board_model` to the intended `jmpseat` Supabase project, confirms only T05 was recorded in migration history, preserves known migration drift handling, and verifies DFW/base-board seed state plus RLS on the new metadata tables.

- [FBMVP-T14 Board Post Read Runtime Pass](ops/fbmvp-t14-board-post-read-runtime-pass.md) - records targeted runtime application of `20260610162000 create_board_post_read_rpc` to the intended `jmpseat` Supabase project, verifies function grants, DB-level read eligibility, safe return fields, `board_posts` RLS/policy posture, and confirms no user/community content was created.
- [FBMVP-T15 Minimal Post Composer](ops/fbmvp-t15-minimal-post-composer.md) - runtime-applied minimal DFW Baseboard title/body composer using a server action and narrow `create_open_baseboard_post` wrapper that resolves DFW by base code, delegates to T13 `create_board_post`, preserves T13 DB-level contribution eligibility, and adds no comments, saves, reactions, search, moderation queue, lounge/restricted posting, Layovers seeded content, Crew Picks ranking, proof-upload scope, direct write policies, deploy, content creation, or broad Supabase `db push`.
- [FBMVP-T15 Minimal Post Composer Runtime Pass](ops/fbmvp-t15-minimal-post-composer-runtime-pass.md) - records targeted runtime application of `20260610182000 create_open_baseboard_post` to the intended `jmpseat` Supabase project, verifies function grants, T13 delegation, `board_posts` RLS/policy posture, and confirms no user/community content was created.
- [FBMVP-T16 Board Post Safety Foundation](ops/fbmvp-t16-board-post-safety-foundation.md) - runtime-applied safety foundation for minimal DFW Baseboard reporting plus an operator-scoped hide/remove RPC, preserving zero direct `board_posts` write policies and adding no post detail, comments, saves, reactions, search, moderation queue UI, AI moderation, bans, lounge/restricted posting, Layovers seeded content, Crew Picks ranking, public sharing, media, proof-upload scope, deploy, T16-created content, or broad Supabase `db push`.

- [Hub Pivot Plan](ops/hub-pivot-plan.md) - locks the approved post-T20 product direction away from raw mixed Baseboards and toward airport/base Hubs with `[AIRPORT] Today`, Base, Layover, Channels, in-section Request a Channel, and Recent Useful Threads while preserving T12-T20 safety primitives and avoiding database renames until separately planned.
- `FBMVP-T21 DFW Hub Product Framing` - implemented locally as a UI/product-framing shell update with no migration: DFW Hub now presents DFW Today, Base, Layover, Channels with in-section Request a Channel, and Recent Useful Threads while preserving existing post/comment/report/moderation primitives and internal Baseboard route/RPC/table names.
- [FBMVP-T21 DFW Hub Product Framing Runtime Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t21-dfw-hub-product-framing-runtime-smoke.md) - records manual beta UI smoke for `8abf799`, confirms DFW Hub, DFW Today, Base, Layover, Channels, Request a Channel inside Channels, and Recent Useful Threads render, marks T21 smoke passed with expected UX debt, and confirms no live weather/traffic, free channel creation, photo uploads, migrations, runtime mutation, or table renames were introduced.
- [FBMVP-T22 Hub Channels IA / Data Model Lock](ops/fbmvp-t22-hub-channels-ia-data-model-lock.md) - docs-only decision record locking the next Channels model: Hub maps to `bases` plus the current parent/base board container, Channel maps to child `boards` rows, Thread maps to `board_posts`, comments map to `board_post_comments`, and reporting/moderation keep using the T12-T20 primitives. It recommends `FBMVP-T23A` DFW Hub Channels UX Wireframe before DB implementation unless implementation needs to proceed directly to `FBMVP-T23` DFW Hub Channels Foundation.
- [FBMVP-T23A Full Mobile Hub Wireframes](ops/fbmvp-t23a-full-mobile-hub-wireframes.md) - docs/design packet for the post-pivot mobile private-beta experience, including Home, DFW Hub sections, Channels browsing, Channel detail, Thread detail, Start a Thread, replies, reporting, saved/empty states, and bottom navigation while avoiding app code, migrations, runtime changes, live integrations, media uploads, free channel creation, and database renames. Visual mockup review approved the overall direction and recorded required cleanup before `FBMVP-T23B`: use compact rows/lists for repeatable items, remove fake scale claims, avoid mutually exclusive states on one screen, keep report affordances quiet, and make Request a Channel secondary. T23B must use fake/mock/static data only, make no Supabase content RPC calls, query/display no real `board_posts`, comments, reports, author IDs, reporter identity, or runtime UGC, and avoid runtime mutation, migrations, and DB/RPC-backed Channels.
- `FBMVP-T23B Protected Static Hub Wireframe Prototype Route` - locally implemented protected admin design route at `/app/admin/design/dfw-hub-wireframes`, rendering the approved T23A mobile screens with fake/static data only. It uses the existing admin-shell authorization boundary and does not call Supabase content RPCs, import community content fetchers, query/display live posts/comments/reports, implement DB/RPC-backed Channels, create migrations, mutate runtime data, or add the route to normal user navigation. Manual beta visual review is recorded in [FBMVP-T23B Static Wireframe Prototype Manual Review](ops/fbmvp-t23b-static-wireframe-prototype-manual-review.md): approved with future UI polish, no functionality blocker, and no need for further prototype polishing before implementation planning.
- [FBMVP-T24A Real Home + DFW Hub Visual Refresh](ops/fbmvp-t24a-real-home-dfw-hub-visual-refresh.md) - locally refreshes the real private-app
  Home/dashboard and real `/app/hubs/dfw` overview using the approved mobile
  visual direction. It keeps Home utility-first, gives DFW Hub a richer hero
  and section-first overview, keeps Request a Channel secondary inside the
  Channels section, and adds no migrations, runtime mutation, new content RPCs,
  live integrations, or DB/RPC-backed Channels.
- [FBMVP-T24A Real Home + DFW Hub Runtime Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t24a-real-home-dfw-hub-runtime-smoke.md) - deployed beta/manual browser smoke for
  `12df45b` on `beta.jmpseat.com`, covering `/app` and `/app/hubs/dfw`.
  It records that the UI still needs visual polish, but no functionality
  blocker was observed and the build path should move forward instead of
  continuing to polish this slice.
- [FBMVP-T25B Hub Channel Board Type + DFW Seeds](ops/fbmvp-t25b-hub-channel-board-type-dfw-seeds.md) - locally adds the `hub_channel`
  board type and six DFW child board seed rows only. The seed list is a
  private-beta default that may change before public release; DB/RPC-backed
  Channels remain incomplete until later channel-aware RPC and UI tickets.
- [FBMVP-T25B Hub Channel Board Type + DFW Seeds Runtime Apply](ops/fbmvp-t25b-hub-channel-board-type-dfw-seeds-runtime-apply.md) - records the targeted runtime
  apply pass for the T25B metadata foundation. Child channel boards now exist in
  runtime. T26A later adds the real Channels overview metadata route; channel-aware
  post RPCs remain future work.
- [FBMVP-T26A Hub Channel List Read + DFW Channels Overview](ops/fbmvp-t26a-hub-channel-list-read-route.md) - locally adds safe active child-channel metadata
  reads and the protected DFW Channels overview route. Channel posts, detail,
  composer, comments, reports, moderation integration, and request/create channel
  workflow remain later tickets.
- [FBMVP-T26A Hub Channel List Read Runtime Apply](ops/fbmvp-t26a-hub-channel-list-read-route-runtime-apply.md) - records the targeted runtime
  apply pass for the T26A metadata RPC. `public.list_open_hub_channels` now
  exists in runtime.
- [FBMVP-T26A DFW Channels Authenticated Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t26a-dfw-channels-authenticated-browser-smoke.md) - records functional
  beta browser smoke for `/app/hubs/dfw/channels`: authenticated eligible access
  rendered the six runtime-backed DFW channel rows, anonymous beta access
  redirected to login, and public apex did not expose the private route. UI/UX
  polish remains deferred.
- [FBMVP-T26B Channel Thread-List Read Foundation](ops/fbmvp-t26b-channel-thread-list-read-foundation.md) - locally adds the selected
  DFW Channel thread-list read foundation.
- [FBMVP-T26B Channel Thread-List Read Runtime Apply](ops/fbmvp-t26b-channel-thread-list-read-foundation-runtime-apply.md) - records targeted runtime
  apply for `public.list_open_hub_channel_posts(...)`.
- [FBMVP-T26B Selected Channel Authenticated Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t26b-selected-channel-authenticated-browser-smoke.md) - records functional
  authenticated smoke for selected-channel thread-list routes. Composer,
  comments, reports, moderation integration, channel post detail, and
  request/create channel workflow remain later tickets.
- [FBMVP-T26C Channel Post Detail Read Foundation](ops/fbmvp-t26c-channel-post-detail-read-foundation.md) - locally adds the selected-channel
  post detail RPC/helper/route and links thread-list rows into
  `/app/hubs/dfw/channels/[channelSlug]/[postId]`. Composer, comments, reports,
  moderation integration, and Request a Channel workflow remain separate work.
- [FBMVP-T26C Channel Post Detail Read Runtime Apply](ops/fbmvp-t26c-channel-post-detail-read-foundation-runtime-apply.md) - records targeted runtime
  apply for the selected-channel post-detail RPC. Runtime now has
  `public.get_open_hub_channel_post(p_base_code text, p_channel_slug text, p_post_id uuid)`;
  partial unavailable-state/access browser smoke is recorded separately.
- [FBMVP-T26C Channel Post Detail Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t26c-channel-post-detail-browser-smoke.md) - records partial selected-channel
  post-detail browser smoke. Initial smoke found no published child-channel
  posts. Later T26D smoke created one safe post, but direct detail navigation
  rendered the safe unavailable state. A later post-fix browser smoke after
  `dfbdc79` confirmed the existing safe post now renders through the detail
  route.
- [FBMVP-T26D Channel Composer / Create Post Foundation](ops/fbmvp-t26d-channel-composer-create-foundation.md) - locally adds selected-channel
  title/body posting through `public.create_open_hub_channel_post(...)` and the
  protected `/app/hubs/dfw/channels/[channelSlug]` route. Runtime apply is
  recorded in
  [FBMVP-T26D Channel Composer / Create Post Runtime Apply](ops/fbmvp-t26d-channel-composer-create-foundation-runtime-apply.md);
  failed/partial browser smoke is recorded in
  [FBMVP-T26D Channel Composer Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t26d-channel-composer-browser-smoke.md), and the local UUID validation fix is recorded in
  [FBMVP-T26D Channel Composer UUID Validation Fix](ops/fbmvp-t26d-channel-composer-uuid-validation-fix.md). Post-fix browser smoke is recorded in
  [FBMVP-T26D/T26C Post-Fix Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t26d-t26c-post-fix-browser-smoke.md); it reuses the existing safe post and does not claim full
  T26D create-browser redirect coverage. Final authorized create-browser smoke is recorded in
  [FBMVP-T26D Final Create Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t26d-final-create-browser-smoke.md); one additional safe post was created, but redirect still failed.
  The local app-side redirect fix is recorded in
  [FBMVP-T26D Channel Composer Redirect Fix](ops/fbmvp-t26d-channel-composer-redirect-fix.md);
  it changes success navigation only and needs no runtime migration. Final
  passing create-redirect smoke is recorded in
  [FBMVP-T26D Final Create Redirect Browser Smoke Pass](ops/fbmvp-t26d-final-create-redirect-browser-smoke-pass.md);
  after `82f4399`, create redirect, T26B list regression, and T26C detail
  regression passed.
- [FBMVP-T27A DFW Today Lightweight Baseline](ops/fbmvp-t27a-dfw-today-lightweight-baseline.md) - locally adds the protected read-only
  `/app/hubs/dfw/today` route with static DFW Today config, quick checks,
  utility cards, safety boundary copy, and links into existing DFW Channels.
  It adds no migration, runtime apply, live integration, AI, posting, comments,
  reports, moderation, Request a Channel workflow, broad database push, or
  deploy. Authenticated browser smoke is recorded in
  [FBMVP-T27A DFW Today Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t27a-dfw-today-browser-smoke.md)
  and passed after deployment.
- [FBMVP-T27B DFW Base Lightweight Baseline](ops/fbmvp-t27b-dfw-base-lightweight-baseline.md) - locally adds the protected read-only
  `/app/hubs/dfw/base` route with static DFW Base config, orientation
  reminders, base essentials, useful next links, safety boundary copy, and
  links into existing DFW Channels and DFW Today. It adds no migration, runtime
  apply, live integration, AI, posting, comments, reports, moderation, Request
  a Channel workflow, broad database push, or deploy. Authenticated browser
  smoke is recorded in
  [FBMVP-T27B DFW Base Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t27b-dfw-base-browser-smoke.md)
  and passed after deployment.
- [FBMVP-T27C DFW Layover Lightweight Baseline](ops/fbmvp-t27c-dfw-layover-lightweight-baseline.md) - locally adds the protected read-only
  `/app/hubs/dfw/layover` route with static DFW Layover config, layover
  planning reminders, layover essentials, useful next links, safety boundary
  copy, and links into existing DFW Channels, DFW Today, and DFW Base. It adds
  no migration, runtime apply, live integration, AI, posting, comments,
  reports, moderation, Request a Channel workflow, exact crew hotel exposure,
  live crew location, broad database push, or deploy. Authenticated browser
  smoke is recorded in
  [FBMVP-T27C DFW Layover Browser Smoke](ops/fbmvp-t27c-dfw-layover-browser-smoke.md)
  and passed after deployment.
- [FBMVP Checkpoint: DFW Hub Baseline Pillars Complete](ops/fbmvp-checkpoint-dfw-hub-baseline-pillars-complete.md) - records the post-T26/T27
  level set: DFW Today, DFW Base, DFW Layover, and Channels are complete at
  lightweight MVP baseline level, while T26E reporting/moderation, Request a
  Channel, UI/UX polish, and private-beta policy/ops readiness remain separate
  work.
- [First-Base MVP Implementation Ticket Pack](epochs/first-base-mvp-implementation-ticket-pack.md) - translates the pivot strategy docs into the ordered `FBMVP` implementation sequence; the immediate post-Epoch-5 narrow lane is first reconciled in `ops/private-beta-readiness-bridge.md`, and auth email branding/custom SMTP is now tracked as a deferred beta-readiness polish TODO rather than the active next auth-flow implementation task.
- [FBMVP-T01: Freeze User-Facing Proof Verification Surfaces](epochs/fbmvp-t01-freeze-user-facing-proof-verification-surfaces.md) - freezes normal proof-upload UX while preserving historical proof infrastructure, cleanup, audit, and admin/operator safety.
- [FBMVP-T02: Airline Email Verification Access State Design](epochs/fbmvp-t02-airline-email-verification-access-state-design.md) - defines the forward `airline_email_verified` app-level eligibility state and how it maps from existing work-email verification foundations.
- [FBMVP-T02: Airline Email Verification Access State Implementation](epochs/fbmvp-t02-airline-email-verification-access-state-implementation.md) - adds the pure helper/adapter for deriving forward airline-email eligibility state without changing gates or creating migrations.
- [FBMVP-T03: Private-Testing Versus First-Base-Launch Gate Implementation](epochs/fbmvp-t03-private-testing-versus-first-base-launch-gate-implementation.md) - adds explicit launch modes and wires airline-email eligibility into the existing private-app access gate without creating migrations or implementing boards.
- [FBMVP-T03A: Beta Invite-Code Foundation Implementation](epochs/fbmvp-t03a-beta-invite-code-foundation-implementation.md) - adds hash-only beta invite-code storage, operator-only server generation, verified-airline-email-gated redemption, and private-testing access-hold entry without changing first-base or broader-launch gates.
- [FBMVP-T03A: Beta Invite-Code Foundation Runtime Pass](ops/beta-invite-code-foundation-runtime-pass.md) - records linked-runtime migration apply and validation for hash-only invite-code generation, redemption, audit behavior, and gate boundaries.
- [FBMVP-T04: Onboarding / Signup Flow Update](epochs/fbmvp-t04-onboarding-signup-flow-update.md) - aligns signup, login, profile, and access-hold copy with the airline-email eligibility and beta invite-code journey without changing gate rules or creating migrations. `/app/verification` is now deprecated in favor of `/app/access-hold`.
- [Founder/Admin Private-App Access Implementation](epochs/founder-admin-private-app-access-implementation.md) - reuses explicit operator grants for narrow internal private-app access during private testing without marking internal accounts as airline-email verified or changing normal user gates.
- [Operator Grant Management Implementation](epochs/operator-grant-management-implementation.md) - adds the authenticated post-bootstrap operator-managed grant path for minimal internal private-app access after the one-time bootstrap route is closed.
- [E05 Operator Grant Management Runtime Pass](ops/e05-operator-grant-management-runtime-pass.md) - records linked-runtime proof for the post-bootstrap operator grant RPC/action path, duplicate safety, non-operator denial, minimal internal scope behavior, and audit metadata redaction.
- [Operator Private-App Scope Gate Fix](ops/operator-private-app-scope-gate-fix.md) - narrows the private-app operator override to `operator.internal_private_app_access` only, keeps unrelated operator/admin tooling scopes separate from app-entry override, and is merged, beta-deployed, and runtime-proven at `03d7455`.
- [Security Events Trust Boundary Fix](ops/security-events-trust-boundary-fix.md) - runtime-proven security hardening that removes direct authenticated inserts into trusted `security_events`, marks legacy audit rows as unverified, keeps operator/admin audit views filtered to trusted server-produced rows, and preserves the server-side/service-role audit writer without broad Supabase `db push`.
- [Proof Upload Content Validation Fix](ops/proof-upload-content-validation-fix.md) - historical deployed proof-upload hardening that stops redacted proof upload from trusting browser MIME/extension alone and requires server-side JPEG/PNG byte validation before private Storage upload; proof uploads are now deprecated/out of current scope, and the old live authenticated mutation test is not an active blocker.
- [Security Headers Hardening](ops/security-headers-hardening.md) - runtime-proven browser header hardening that adds `nosniff`, strict-origin referrer policy, restrictive permissions policy, enforced anti-framing, and report-only broad CSP while leaving Vercel-provided HSTS unchanged and preserving public/beta behavior.
- [Public Vercel Analytics Readiness](ops/public-vercel-analytics-readiness.md) - review-ready public-only Vercel Web Analytics instrumentation for apex/`www` waitlist, Privacy, and Terms pages with host/path allowlisting, privacy-copy disclosure, and explicit exclusion of beta/auth/admin/app/lab routes.
- [Public Vercel Analytics Runtime Pass](ops/public-vercel-analytics-runtime-pass.md) - records deployment of public-only Vercel Web Analytics to apex/`www`, verification that analytics appears only on `/`, `/privacy`, and `/terms`, and preservation of beta/auth/app/admin/lab exclusion.
- [Beta Vercel Env Scoping](ops/beta-vercel-env-scoping.md) - records the persistent Preview env strategy for `beta.jmpseat.com`, including the required Supabase env names, the root cause of prior deployment-scoped env injection, normal beta deploy verification without manual Supabase env injection, and apex/`www` preservation.
- [Epoch 5 Final Closeout](ops/epoch-5-final-closeout.md) - closes the bounded operator/admin/security hardening lane with explicit carry-forward items for deprecated proof-upload scope, CSP reporting/enforcement, Vercel deployment-model maturity, Supabase migration-history drift handling, auth email branding/custom SMTP, and the next community-access/moderation lane.
- [Private Beta Readiness Bridge](ops/private-beta-readiness-bridge.md) - reconciles the closed Epoch 5 baseline with the broader private-beta docs, keeps proof uploads deprecated/out of current scope while preserving historical privacy/security obligations, tracks auth email branding/custom SMTP as deferred trust/deliverability polish, and defines the narrow lane before broader 05B / community-access implementation.
- [Post-E05 Public Waitlist Launch Plan](ops/post-e05-public-waitlist-launch-plan.md) - current planning source for the public `jmpseat.com` waitlist release, first-party capture, first-party metrics/admin dashboard, and Vercel/Supabase/Expo architecture direction.
- [Public Waitlist Page Polish](ops/public-waitlist-page-polish.md) - implementation note for first-party public waitlist email capture, optional product-shaping follow-up questions, safe persistence, and the continued separation from private beta/auth/admin.
- [Waitlist Question Research Selection](ops/waitlist-question-research-selection.md) - research-derived optional public waitlist follow-up question set and sensitive-data boundaries.
- [Waitlist Metrics Dashboard](ops/waitlist-metrics-dashboard.md) - implementation note for the operator/admin-only `/app/admin/waitlist` dashboard, aggregate demand signals and database-projected masked contact labels for `operator.read_audit`, server-side raw-contact loading only after `operator.view_waitlist_contacts`, controlled post-bootstrap waitlist-contact grants, first-operator bootstrap alignment for fresh environments, and pending runtime validation.
- [Public Waitlist Launch Readiness Check](ops/public-waitlist-launch-readiness-check.md) - W05 audit for root-domain launch readiness, W05A metadata/legal/accessibility blocker resolution, post-copy-polish readiness rerun status, rollback steps, and the final cutover checklist for moving the public waitlist to `jmpseat.com` while keeping `beta.jmpseat.com` private.
- [Public Waitlist Root Cutover Runtime Pass](ops/public-waitlist-root-cutover-runtime-pass.md) - records the successful `jmpseat.com` apex cutover, root waitlist capture/survey runtime proof, beta preservation checks, social metadata proof, rollback plan, and the remaining `www` DNS follow-up.
- [Public Waitlist Www Runtime Pass](ops/public-waitlist-www-runtime-pass.md) - records the successful `www.jmpseat.com` DNS/Vercel alias follow-up, public waitlist smoke test, apex preservation, beta preservation, and local resolver-cache caveat.
- [Waitlist Duplicate Survey Token Fix](ops/waitlist-duplicate-survey-token-fix.md) - runtime-proven security hardening for preventing anonymous duplicate waitlist submissions from receiving an existing signup's survey token or editing another signup's optional survey answers.
- Public-domain app access guard - fixed in
  `bad2110 fix: gate private app on public domain`:
  `jmpseat.com` and `www.jmpseat.com` remain marketing/waitlist-only, public
  `/app` and private-beta auth entry paths are redirected server-side to `/`,
  and private app entry belongs on `beta.jmpseat.com` while protected beta
  surfaces continue to require auth, beta access, profile completion,
  verification state, and route-specific authorization. Longer term, prefer
  separate Vercel projects/deployments, or at least separately configured
  deployments, for public marketing and private beta app surfaces.
- Admin shell authorization - fixed in
  `5e65f7b fix: require admin authorization for admin shell`: `/app/admin`
  now requires reviewer authorization or an active operator grant after the
  private-app gate. Signed-out admin access redirects to login. A logged-in
  non-admin browser check remains a pre-beta-launch verification item once a
  non-admin beta test user exists; it is not a reason to keep the First Base /
  DFW Baseboard epoch open.
- [Auth Email Branding / Confirmation Template Ops Plan](ops/auth-email-branding-confirmation-template-plan.md) - deferred TODO package for branded jmpseat auth-email polish, covering ownership split across already-working Supabase and repo-owned email flows, sender/domain requirements, callback/redirect expectations, template copy targets, manual dashboard/provider steps, and later validation if this trust/deliverability work is activated.

- [Account Signup Code Confirmation Implementation](epochs/account-signup-code-confirmation-implementation.md) - switches normal Supabase account email confirmation to a code-first signup UX using Supabase Auth-native six-digit account confirmation codes while keeping airline employee email verification, beta access, launch mode, and legacy token-hash auth routes separate.
- [Auth Detour Closeout Runtime Pass](ops/auth-detour-closeout-runtime-pass.md) - records founder-confirmed stable beta auth runtime pass, `/app/access-hold` as the active verification/status surface, the soft-disable of the temporary `jmpseat.com` approved-domain workaround, and the return lane to Epoch 5 operator/admin tooling.

Documentation hygiene reminder:

- Future tickets should identify documentation impact and include docs-update acceptance criteria when applicable. See `PRODUCT_DELIVERY_OPERATING_MODEL.md`.
- Current implementation work is paused for the product pivot. E05-T08 should not proceed until pivot planning is complete, and future tasks should not expand proof-upload verification unless explicitly instructed.
- E05-T07 runtime proof is committed on `main`; if an older or parallel branch still has uncommitted E05-T07 runtime-proof docs, commit those before starting pivot planning.
- Next implementation work should follow the post-E05 public waitlist launch lane in `ops/post-e05-public-waitlist-launch-plan.md`: keep first-party public waitlist capture Beta Access-free, keep `beta.jmpseat.com` as the private beta/auth/admin surface, preserve the future Expo/EAS native path, and use `ops/public-waitlist-launch-readiness-check.md`, `ops/public-waitlist-root-cutover-runtime-pass.md`, `ops/public-waitlist-www-runtime-pass.md`, and `ops/waitlist-duplicate-survey-token-fix.md` as the current W05 launch record. W05A addresses the prior metadata/legal/accessibility launch blockers in code, the public homepage and legal-copy polish are merged, root `jmpseat.com` now serves the public waitlist with runtime-proven capture and optional survey persistence, `www.jmpseat.com` now serves the same public waitlist experience, and duplicate survey-token hardening is migration-first deployed and runtime-proven. Tally is backup/research-only unless intentionally reintroduced later. `FBMVP-T01` through `FBMVP-T04`, auth design-system overhaul, founder/admin internal access, post-bootstrap operator grant management, app-generated work-email verification codes, account signup code confirmation, auth detour closeout, public waitlist runtime validation, waitlist dashboard runtime validation, and founder full-contact dashboard visual confirmation are already implemented or documented in their respective epoch/ops notes. `ops/auth-email-branding-confirmation-template-plan.md` remains the deferred Supabase Auth confirmation/reset branding TODO for trust/deliverability/polish; it is not an auth-flow implementation blocker. Content/moderation policy can still be refined before live community launch if needed.
- First Base closeout access baseline: public `jmpseat.com` /
  `www.jmpseat.com` stay marketing/waitlist-only through the `bad2110`
  host-boundary guard, and `/app/admin` requires reviewer authorization or an
  active operator grant through the `5e65f7b` admin-shell authorization fix.
  Keep `beta.jmpseat.com` as the private beta app/auth/admin host. A logged-in
  non-admin admin-shell browser check remains a pre-beta-launch verification
  item once a non-admin beta test user exists, not a reason to keep the First
  Base / DFW Baseboard epoch open.

Scalability guardrail:

- Future auth, database, community, moderation, storage, search, admin, and AI tickets should follow `SCALABILITY_AND_ARCHITECTURE_REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- Future auth, account/profile, beta-access, verification, community, moderation, notifications, storage, admin, and AI tickets should also follow `MOBILE_APP_STRATEGY.md`.

Client-scope rule:

- Future implementation tickets must identify whether the work is `web-only`, `mobile-ready`, or `shared-core`.
- If a ticket is `shared-core` or `mobile-ready`, it must describe how the logic, data access, and authorization rules can be reused by a future mobile client.

## Current 05B Lane

Use `ops/05b-first-base-mvp-planning.md` as the controlling note for the
current 05B implementation start.

Use `strategy/base-board-product-definition.md` as the canonical product
definition for what a Base Board is when extending the T05/T06 foundation.

Use `strategy/home-base-board-follow-decision.md` as the canonical product
decision for Home Base and Board Follow behavior in T06 and later follow
surfaces.

Use `strategy/home-dashboard-product-definition.md` as the canonical product
definition for the first private-app Home Dashboard before implementing
restricted lounge access or the DFW Base Board dashboard shell.

Use `strategy/verified-lounge-access-model.md` as the canonical product
definition for Verified Lounge access, request lifecycle, Crew Lead scope, and
privacy boundaries before implementing `FBMVP-T07`.

Current first code ticket:

- `FBMVP-T05: Base, Board, And Board-Type Data Model Design`

Current T05 implementation status:

- Merged on `main` at `87b7693`.
- Runtime-applied to the intended `jmpseat` Supabase project through the
  targeted T05 pass recorded in `ops/fbmvp-t05-base-board-runtime-pass.md`.
- Adds `bases`, `board_types`, and `boards`.
- Seeds DFW as the first launch base and DFW Base Board as the first available
  board.
- Initial rollout remains DFW-only; T06 should use an optional DFW-start choice
  instead of a fake one-option Home Base picker.
- Seeds board types `base_board`, `layover_board`, and `verified_lounge`.
- Does not implement follows, home-base preferences, memberships, access
  requests, posts, comments, saves, reactions, search, reports, or moderation.

Current T06 implementation status:

- Merged on `main` at `a4cb0b1`.
- The intended Supabase runtime already has the T06 schema/functions recorded
  as remote migration `20260609194858 create_home_base_board_follows`.
- The local repo T06 file remains
  `20260609130534_create_home_base_board_follows.sql`; do not re-apply it and
  do not mark `20260609130534` applied retroactively.
- Adds `user_home_base_preferences` and `board_follows`.
- Adds an authenticated `set_user_home_base(p_base_code text)` RPC to set the
  current user's Home Base and auto-follow the matching active Base Board.
- Follow-up migration
  `20260609200310_harden_home_base_rpc_execute_grants.sql` removes explicit
  `anon` EXECUTE from the three T06 RPCs and preserves authenticated/service
  role execution.
- The targeted runtime apply pass for that hardening is recorded in
  `ops/fbmvp-t06-home-base-board-follows-runtime-pass.md`.
- Adds server-side helper functions for reading Home Base/follows and setting
  Home Base through the RPC.
- Keeps missing Home Base as a valid initial DFW-only rollout state that does
  not block app access.
- Keeps Home Base and follows as personalization/subscription state only.
- Does not grant restricted access, create lounge memberships, create access
  requests, or rely on self-declared `claimed_base`, `claimed_airline`, or
  `claimed_role`.
- Future runtime schema changes must still use targeted apply because known
  Supabase migration-history drift remains.

Current T07 implementation status:

- T07 is merged and runtime-applied.
- Runtime migration history includes
  `20260609220055 create_lounge_access_foundation`.
- Adds `lounge_memberships`, `lounge_access_requests`,
  `lounge_request_comments`, and `lounge_admin_grants`.
- Keeps active lounge membership as the future restricted content access truth.
- Keeps requests, Home Base, board follows, and self-declared profile fields
  from granting lounge access.
- Adds RLS and authenticated read policies scoped to own rows or active Crew
  Lead grants.
- Does not add direct write policies or mutation RPCs.
- Does not implement UI, posts/comments, saves/reactions, search, moderation,
  AI, marketplace/deals, or proof-upload scope.
- The runtime pass used targeted apply only. Known Supabase migration-history
  drift remains and still blocks broad `supabase db push`.

DFW is the first launch base and the DFW Base Board is the first available base
board. DFW is not the whole product concept. The data model should support many
bases, base boards, layover boards, Verified Lounges / restricted role-based
spaces, follows/subscriptions, memberships, community-admin grants, and future
posts/comments/saves/reactions/search from the start.

Current sequence:

1. `FBMVP-T05` base, board, and board-type data model
2. `FBMVP-T06` Home Base preference and board-follow foundation, governed by
   the Home Base and Board Follow decision note
3. Home Dashboard product definition, governing the first private-app screen
   hierarchy before `FBMVP-T07`/`FBMVP-T08`
4. `FBMVP-T07` restricted lounge membership/access request/Crew Lead foundation
5. Hub / Board taxonomy, governing Hubs, Baseboard, Layovers, Lounges, Crew
   Picks, and MVP seeded Layovers before further dashboard/discovery/posting
   implementation
6. `FBMVP-T08` Home Dashboard and DFW Hub read-only shell
7. `FBMVP-T09` Start with DFW Home Base action
8. `FBMVP-T10` DFW Hub section read-only route shells
9. `FBMVP-T11` Seeded Layovers strategy and editorial model
10. `FBMVP-T12` shared post/thread foundation, merged and runtime-applied
11. `FBMVP-T13` server-controlled create-post foundation, merged and runtime-applied
12. `FBMVP-T14` board post read foundation, merged and runtime-applied
13. `FBMVP-T15` minimal DFW Baseboard post composer, merged and runtime-applied
14. `FBMVP-T16` board post safety foundation, merged and runtime-applied
15. `FBMVP-T17` DFW Baseboard post detail, merged and runtime-applied
16. `FBMVP-T18` DFW Baseboard moderation review, merged and runtime-applied
17. `FBMVP-T19` DFW Baseboard comments foundation, merged and runtime-applied
18. `FBMVP-T20` DFW Baseboard comment reporting/moderation review integration, merged and runtime-applied

T20 runtime-pass docs are committed. The First Base / DFW Baseboard safety loop
is complete. The approved post-T20 direction is now recorded in
`ops/hub-pivot-plan.md`: move away from raw mixed Baseboards toward curated
airport/base Hubs with `[AIRPORT] Today`, Base, Layover, Channels, an in-section
Request a Channel action, and Recent Useful Threads. T21 implements that DFW Hub
product framing locally while preserving existing posts/comments/reporting/
moderation primitives and avoiding database table renames.

Recommended direction:

- shared Baseboard post/thread foundation now exists as the T12 data layer
  direction and is runtime-applied; seeded Layovers should build on those
  shared post/thread primitives rather than introducing a separate content
  foundation first.
- The T12 runtime pass is recorded in
  `ops/fbmvp-t12-board-posts-runtime-pass.md`. Known Supabase
  migration-history drift remains and still blocks broad `supabase db push`.
- T13 is runtime-applied as `20260610143547 create_board_post_rpc`. The
  runtime pass is recorded in `ops/fbmvp-t13-create-post-runtime-pass.md`.
- T13 now requires DB-level contribution eligibility before insert; auth alone
  is not enough. The current eligibility rule requires completed profile plus
  operator internal private-app access or active beta access with verified
  work-email / aviation-worker status.
- Self-declared profile fields do not grant posting rights.
- T13 does not add comments, saves/reactions, search backend, AI moderation,
  seeded layover content, lounge/restricted posting, or full posting UI.
- T14 is runtime-applied as `20260610162000 create_board_post_read_rpc`. The
  runtime pass is recorded in
  `ops/fbmvp-t14-board-post-read-runtime-pass.md`.
- T14 adds read-only DFW Baseboard post rendering, safe handle-only author
  labels with `jmpseat member` fallback, and an empty state when no published
  posts exist. It does not add a composer, post creation UI, comments, saves,
  reactions, search, lounge/restricted content, seeded layover implementation,
  proof-upload scope, content creation, deploy, or runtime settings changes.
- T15 is runtime-applied as `20260610182000 create_open_baseboard_post`. The
  runtime pass is recorded in
  `ops/fbmvp-t15-minimal-post-composer-runtime-pass.md`. It adds a minimal DFW
  Baseboard title/body composer through a server action only. The wrapper RPC
  resolves DFW by base code to the active `open_verified` `base_board`,
  delegates to T13 `public.create_board_post(...)`, and preserves T13 DB-level
  contribution eligibility as final authority.
- T15 does not add comments, saves/reactions, search backend, moderation queue,
  lounge/restricted posting, Layovers seeded content, Crew Picks ranking,
  proof-upload scope, direct `board_posts` write policies, deploy, runtime
  settings changes, or content creation during validation/runtime verification.
- T16 is runtime-applied as
  `20260610191809 create_board_post_safety_foundation`. The runtime pass is
  recorded in `ops/fbmvp-t16-board-post-safety-runtime-pass.md`. It adds minimal
  DFW Baseboard reporting, a private
  `board_post_reports` table, `public.report_open_baseboard_post(...)`, and
  operator-scoped `public.moderate_open_baseboard_post(...)` for hide/remove
  actions using `operator.community_moderation`.
- T16 preserves zero direct board_posts write policies. Hidden/removed posts
  are excluded from current read surfaces because T14 reads only published
  board-visible posts.
- T16 does not add post detail, comments, saves/reactions, search backend,
  moderation queue UI, AI moderation, bans, lounge/restricted posting, Layovers
  seeded content, Crew Picks ranking, public sharing, media, proof-upload scope,
  deploy, runtime settings changes, or T16-created posts/reports/moderation
  records during migration/apply. Runtime verification found
  `public.board_post_reports` count `0` and `public.board_posts` count `1`; the
  existing post is user-created test content separate from the T16
  migration/apply.
- T17 is runtime-applied as
  `20260610203000 create_open_baseboard_post_detail_rpc`. It adds a private
  `/app/hubs/dfw/baseboard/[postId]` detail route and
  `public.get_open_baseboard_post(p_base_code text, p_post_id uuid)`. The
  runtime pass is recorded in
  `ops/fbmvp-t17-dfw-baseboard-post-detail-runtime-pass.md`.
- T17 uses the same private DFW route gate, DB-level open-board read
  eligibility, active base-code/open verified Baseboard scoping, `published` /
  `board` filtering, safe handle-only author label, and existing DFW Baseboard
  report affordance. Hidden/removed posts remain excluded because reads filter
  to published board-visible posts.
- T17 does not add comments/replies, saves/reactions, search backend,
  moderation queue UI, public sharing, lounge/restricted posting, Layovers
  content, Crew Picks ranking, media, AI moderation, bans, proof-upload scope,
  direct `board_posts` write policies, deploy, runtime settings changes, or
  content/report/moderation record creation during validation/runtime
  verification.
- T17 runtime verification used catalog/count checks only. No post content was
  read or printed. `public.board_posts` count was `1`, and
  `public.board_post_reports` count was `0`. No posts, reports, moderation
  records, comments, replies, saves, reactions, search indexes, or
  user/community content were created by T17 migration/apply.
- T18 is runtime-applied as
  `20260610235111 create_board_post_report_review_rpc`. The runtime pass is
  recorded in
  `ops/fbmvp-t18-dfw-baseboard-moderation-review-runtime-pass.md`. It adds app-side
  `operator.community_moderation` support, `/app/admin/community-moderation`,
  a safe `public.list_open_baseboard_post_reports(...)` RPC, a server-only
  report read helper, and a server action that calls existing T16
  `public.moderate_open_baseboard_post(...)`.
- T18 allows only hide/remove actions for reported DFW Baseboard posts and does
  not expose reporter identity or sensitive verification/proof data.
- T18 preserves zero direct `board_posts` write policies. It does not add
  comments, replies, saves/reactions, search backend, Crew Picks, Layovers,
  public sharing, appeal workflow, bans, AI moderation, proof-upload scope,
  comment moderation, deploy, runtime settings changes, or content/report/
  moderation record creation during local validation or runtime apply.
- T18 runtime verification used catalog/permission/count checks only. The review
  RPC was not called for content smoke, and no report details, post title, post
  body, author labels, reporter information, or runtime content was read or
  printed. `public.board_posts` count was `1`, and
  `public.board_post_reports` count was `0`. No posts, reports, moderation
  records, comments, replies, saves, reactions, search indexes, or
  user/community content were created by T18 migration/apply.
- Known migration drift remains preserved and broad `supabase db push` remains
  unsafe.
- T19 is runtime-applied as
  `20260611001000 create_board_post_comments_foundation`. It adds top-level DFW
  Baseboard comments on post detail through safe read/create RPCs, server-only
  helpers/actions, and an operator hide/remove RPC for comment safety.
- T19 includes a server-side operator-scoped comment moderation action that wraps
  `public.moderate_open_baseboard_post_comment(...)`, uses `p_base_code = "DFW"`,
  requires `operator.community_moderation`, validates comment UUID plus
  `hide`/`remove` and bounded reason, records a security event without exposing
  post/comment content, and revalidates only safe relevant routes.
- T19 uses T13-equivalent contribution eligibility for comment creation,
  preserves zero direct `board_posts` write policies, and avoids direct
  anon/authenticated comment table writes.
- T19 does not expose author IDs, emails, claimed fields, verification/proof
  data, reporter identity, signed URLs, private paths, removal fields, or
  moderation metadata through comment reads.
- T19 does not add nested replies, comment reporting, comment moderation review
  UI, a comment moderation queue, saves/reactions, search backend, Crew Picks,
  Layovers, public sharing, lounge/restricted posting, media, AI moderation,
  bans, appeals, proof-upload scope, deploy, runtime settings changes, or
  content/comment/moderation record creation during local validation or runtime
  apply.
- T19 runtime verification used catalog/permission/schema/count checks only.
  Comment create/read/moderation RPCs were not called for live row output, and
  no comment/post/report content was read or printed. `public.board_posts` count
  was `1`, `public.board_post_reports` count was `0`, and
  `public.board_post_comments` count was `0`.
- Known migration drift remains preserved and broad Supabase `db push` remains
  unsafe.
- T20 is runtime-applied as
  `20260611014500 create_board_post_comment_reports`. The runtime pass is
  recorded in
  `ops/fbmvp-t20-dfw-baseboard-comment-reporting-review-runtime-pass.md`. It
  adds private `public.board_post_comment_reports` storage, safe
  `public.report_open_baseboard_post_comment(...)` and
  `public.list_open_baseboard_post_comment_reports(...)` RPCs, a server-side
  comment report action, compact comment report affordances, and a separate
  comment reports section in `/app/admin/community-moderation`.
- T20 uses `operator.community_moderation` for comment report review and the
  existing T19 comment hide/remove action/RPC for decisions.
- T20 hides reporter identity by default, preserves zero direct `board_posts`
  write policies, and avoids direct anon/authenticated comment report table
  access.
- T20 does not add nested replies, saves/reactions, search backend, Crew Picks,
  Layovers, public sharing, lounge/restricted posting, media, AI moderation,
  bans, appeals, proof-upload scope, deploy, runtime settings changes, or
  content/report/comment/moderation record creation during local validation or
  runtime apply.
- T20 runtime verification used catalog/permission/schema/count checks only. No
  comment report/review RPCs were called for live row output, and no
  post/comment/report content, author labels, reporter information, user IDs, or
  runtime content was read or printed. `public.board_posts` count was `1`,
  `public.board_post_reports` count was `0`, `public.board_post_comments` count
  was `0`, and `public.board_post_comment_reports` count was `0`.
- Known migration drift remains preserved and broad Supabase `db push` remains
  unsafe.
- T20 runtime-pass docs are committed. The First Base / DFW Baseboard safety
  loop is complete. The approved Hub pivot direction is recorded in
  `ops/hub-pivot-plan.md`: Baseboards should no longer be the main
  product-facing concept, and the next implementation ticket should reframe DFW
  around `DFW Hub`, `DFW Today`, Base, Layover, Channels, and Recent Useful
  Threads without weakening existing safety controls or renaming database
  tables in the same step.
- T21 implements that product framing locally with no migration. Existing
  internal Baseboard route/RPC/table names remain in place while the product
  shell presents DFW Today, Base, Layover, Channels, Request a Channel inside
  Channels, and Recent Useful Threads.
- T21 post-deploy manual beta UI smoke passed for commit `8abf799`. The result
  confirms the Hub framing renders but does not claim final Hub UX completion:
  the surface remains placeholder-heavy, Request a Channel should become a
  lower-priority secondary action inside Channels, and test/seed content is not
  real production UGC or a data-migration blocker.

Do not let older broad V1/backlog sections below turn this into an unsequenced
social feed or marketplace build. For the current lane, keep proof uploads,
manual proof/document uploads, generic global Crew Rooms expansion,
media/upload posting, AI auto-publishing, deals, full mobile scope, and
anonymous posting unless separately approved out of scope.

## Required First Implementation Sequence

Use this order when implementation begins:

1. App scaffold.
2. Auth foundation.
3. User/profile model.
4. Verification model.
5. Crew Rooms.
6. Base Boards.
7. Posts/comments.
8. Moderation/reporting.
9. Jumpseat Brief MVP.
10. Admin dashboard.

Current-status note:

- The sequence above remains a broad historical backlog reference.
- It is not the controlling first 05B implementation lane.
- For the current start point, use `ops/05b-first-base-mvp-planning.md` and
  begin with `FBMVP-T05`.

The detailed backlog below includes supporting storage, authorization, and policy tickets around that sequence, but the sequence above should guide the first build pass.

Sequencing guardrail: Crew Rooms, Base Boards, and posts/comments may be implemented structurally before moderation is complete only in a local, non-user-facing, non-beta state. Real anonymous posting, member-generated content exposure, or beta use must remain blocked until auth/authorization, aviation-worker verification, reporting, moderation queue, emergency escalation, trust/safety rules, and admin controls are ready.
