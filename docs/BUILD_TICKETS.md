# Build Tickets

Brand note: jmpseat is the canonical product and app name. This document does not claim legal or trademark clearance for the name.
Rename note: Deadhead Club is retired and should not be used in current docs, UI, code, or planning. Older Git history may still contain legacy references.

This is a prioritized implementation plan for a future build phase. No app code is included in this documentation-only repository initialization.

Labels used: docs, product, foundation, auth, verification, community, moderation, AI, monetization, admin, later.

- [Account Signup Code Confirmation Implementation](epochs/account-signup-code-confirmation-implementation.md) - switches normal Supabase account email confirmation to a code-first signup UX using Supabase Auth-native six-digit account confirmation codes while keeping airline employee email verification, beta access, launch mode, and legacy token-hash auth routes separate.

Documentation hygiene reminder:

- Future tickets should identify documentation impact and include docs-update acceptance criteria when applicable. See `PRODUCT_DELIVERY_OPERATING_MODEL.md`.
- Current implementation work is paused for the product pivot. E05-T08 should not proceed until pivot planning is complete, and future tasks should not expand proof-upload verification unless explicitly instructed.
- E05-T07 runtime proof is committed on `main`; if an older or parallel branch still has uncommitted E05-T07 runtime-proof docs, commit those before starting pivot planning.
- Next implementation work should follow the First-Base MVP Implementation Ticket Pack. `FBMVP-T01 Freeze User-Facing Proof Verification Surfaces` is implemented and merged; `FBMVP-T02 Airline Email Verification Access State` helper implementation is complete and merged; `FBMVP-T03 Private-Testing Versus First-Base-Launch Gate Implementation` is implemented and merged; `FBMVP-T03A Beta Invite-Code Foundation` is implemented and runtime-proven on the linked Supabase runtime; `FBMVP-T04 Onboarding/Signup Flow Update` is implemented and merged; the auth design-system overhaul now makes `/app/access-hold` the canonical airline employee email verification surface and deprecates `/app/verification` as a standalone page; founder/admin internal private-app access now uses explicit operator grants instead of temporary airline-domain abuse; post-bootstrap operator grant management is now implemented; app-generated work-email verification codes are implemented with inline access-hold entry and legacy confirm-route compatibility; the founder-confirmed stable beta auth detour is closed and the temporary `jmpseat.com` approved-domain workaround is soft-disabled. Return to Epoch 5 operator/admin tooling level-set work next. `ops/auth-email-branding-confirmation-template-plan.md` remains the Supabase Auth confirmation/reset branding plan before public-ish waitlist login entry. Content/moderation policy can still be refined before live community launch if needed.

Scalability guardrail:

- Future auth, database, community, moderation, storage, search, admin, and AI tickets should follow `SCALABILITY_AND_ARCHITECTURE_REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- Future auth, account/profile, beta-access, verification, community, moderation, notifications, storage, admin, and AI tickets should also follow `MOBILE_APP_STRATEGY.md`.

Client-scope rule:

- Future implementation tickets must identify whether the work is `web-only`, `mobile-ready`, or `shared-core`.
- If a ticket is `shared-core` or `mobile-ready`, it must describe how the logic, data access, and authorization rules can be reused by a future mobile client.

## Required First Implementation Sequence

Use this order when implementation begins:

1. App scaffold.
2. Auth foundation.
3. User/profile model.
4. Verification model.
5. Crew Rooms.
6. Base Boards.
7. Posts/comments.
8. Moderation/reporting.
9. Jumpseat Brief MVP.
10. Admin dashboard.

The detailed backlog below includes supporting storage, authorization, and policy tickets around that sequence, but the sequence above should guide the first build pass.

Sequencing guardrail: Crew Rooms, Base Boards, and posts/comments may be implemented structurally before moderation is complete only in a local, non-user-facing, non-beta state. Real anonymous posting, member-generated content exposure, or beta use must remain blocked until auth/authorization, aviation-worker verification, reporting, moderation queue, emergency escalation, trust/safety rules, and admin controls are ready.
