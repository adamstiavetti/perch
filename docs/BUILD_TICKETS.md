# Build Tickets

Working name note: "Deadhead Club" is a working product name pending legal and trademark clearance. This document does not claim legal or trademark clearance.

This is a prioritized implementation plan for a future build phase. No app code is included in this documentation-only repository initialization.

Labels used: docs, product, foundation, auth, verification, community, moderation, AI, monetization, admin, later.

Supplemental epoch-specific ticket packs:

- [Epoch 02: Private App Foundation Ticket Pack](epochs/epoch-02-private-app-foundation-tickets.md)

Documentation hygiene reminder:

- Future tickets should identify documentation impact and include docs-update acceptance criteria when applicable. See `PRODUCT_DELIVERY_OPERATING_MODEL.md`.

## Required First Implementation Sequence

Use this order when implementation begins:

1. App scaffold.
2. Auth foundation.
3. User/profile model.
4. Verification model.
5. Crew Rooms.
6. Base Boards.
7. Posts/comments.
8. Moderation/reporting.
9. Jumpseat Brief MVP.
10. Admin dashboard.

The detailed backlog below includes supporting storage, authorization, and policy tickets around that sequence, but the sequence above should guide the first build pass.

Sequencing guardrail: Crew Rooms, Base Boards, and posts/comments may be implemented structurally before moderation is complete only in a local, non-user-facing, non-beta state. Real anonymous posting, member-generated content exposure, or beta use must remain blocked until auth/authorization, aviation-worker verification, reporting, moderation queue, emergency escalation, trust/safety rules, and admin controls are ready.
