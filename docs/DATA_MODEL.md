# Data Model

Brand note: jmpseat is the canonical product and app name. This document does not claim legal or trademark clearance for the name.

This is a first-pass implementation-ready model. It is intentionally moderate in complexity and should be refined during technical design.

## Scale-Readiness Requirement

Future schema work must follow `SCALABILITY_AND_ARCHITECTURE_REQUIREMENTS.md`.

That means future tables and schema revisions should account for:

- indexing on high-growth tables
- pagination on user/community/admin-facing lists
- ownership and access-control fields
- moderation/report/review state where relevant
- soft-delete or status-based removal where audit history matters
- separation between auth identity, profile data, beta access, verification state, and admin/moderation state

## User

## Base

Current T05 implementation note:

- `bases` is implemented as the First-Base MVP base/airport community anchor
  table.
- DFW is seeded as the first launch base, but the table is designed for many
  bases from the start.
- Self-declared profile base text remains separate and must not become
  authorization truth.

## BoardType

Current T05 implementation note:

- `board_types` is implemented as controlled board taxonomy.
- Seeded types are `base_board`, `layover_board`, and `verified_lounge`.
- Verified Lounges are modeled as a board type.
- Board wiki/intel is not a board type; it should be structured content
  attached to boards in a later ticket.

## Subscription

Deferred paid-account or premium-access entity.

V1 status:

- Do not model Subscription in V1 unless payments or premium features are explicitly approved.
- Do not add payment, billing, Stripe customer, or subscription lifecycle fields until Stripe/payments enter scope.
- If premium subscriptions are approved later, model Subscription separately from core verification, trust, and posting access so paid status cannot override safety or verification rules.

## AuditLog

Product/audit abstraction rather than a required standalone V1 table.

V1 strategy:

- Audit requirements should be backed by SecurityEvent, ModerationAction, verification decision history, admin action history, and relevant timestamp/reviewer fields.
- Do not duplicate sensitive logs into a separate AuditLog table unless there is a clear query, retention, compliance, or operational purpose.
- If a distinct AuditLog is added later, it must align with SecurityEvent and ModerationAction semantics and avoid copying raw verification artifacts, private notes, or sensitive content unnecessarily.

## Relationship Summary

- User owns Profile, Verification records, content, saved items, reports, moderation actions, AI briefs, and trust level.
- Profile connects User to Airline, Role, and Base.
- Base connects Airline and Airport.
- CrewRoom can represent airline, role, base, airport, or topic communities.
- Posts belong to CrewRooms; Comments belong to Posts.
- LayoverBoard belongs to Airport and powers layover-specific content and AI briefs.
- Deals belong to Vendors and may be airport-specific.
- Reports and ModerationActions enforce accountability across content and accounts.
- SecurityEvent records sensitive audit trails.
- UploadArtifact separates private file metadata from public profile and content records.
- Subscription is deferred until payments or premium features are explicitly in scope.
- AuditLog is covered by SecurityEvent, ModerationAction, verification decision history, and admin action history unless a later design needs a distinct table.

## Model Boundaries for V1

Do not model airline portal credentials, scraped schedules, live crew locations, flight-load request infrastructure, payments, subscriptions, native mobile device records, or roster/calendar integrations in V1.

## Data Modeling Best Practices

- Prefer explicit enums or constrained values for account_status, verification status, room type, visibility, moderation action type, and report category.
- Use database constraints for critical invariants.
- Keep public profile data separate from private verification data.
- Store only metadata needed for uploaded artifacts; do not store original filenames in clear text if they may contain personal information.
- Make sensitive audit logs append-only in application behavior.
- Design retention fields before launch rather than adding deletion as an afterthought.
