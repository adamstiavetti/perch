# Data Model

Brand note: jmpseat is the canonical product and app name. This document does not claim legal or trademark clearance for the name.

This is a first-pass implementation-ready model. It is intentionally moderate in complexity and should be refined during technical design.

## Scale-Readiness Requirement

Future schema work must follow `SCALABILITY_AND_ARCHITECTURE_REQUIREMENTS.md`.

That means future tables and schema revisions should account for:

- indexing on high-growth tables
- pagination on user/community/admin-facing lists
- ownership and access-control fields
- moderation/report/review state where relevant
- soft-delete or status-based removal where audit history matters
- separation between auth identity, profile data, beta access, verification state, and admin/moderation state

## User

Auth-level account.

Important fields:

- id
- email
- email_verified_at
- auth_provider_id
- account_status
- is_admin
- created_at
- updated_at
- last_login_at
- deleted_at

Relationships:

- Has one Profile.
- Has many Verifications.
- Has many Posts, Comments, SavedItems, Reports, ModerationActions, and AIBriefs.
- Has one current TrustLevel.

Home Dashboard note:

- `strategy/home-dashboard-product-definition.md` defines the first
  private-app Home Dashboard as a utility dashboard, not a generic social feed.
- The dashboard should eventually use Home Base, followed boards, Crew Picks,
  lounges, saved items, and access-aware search without making any
  personalization signal authorization truth.

## Profile

Aviation identity and public display settings.

Current 05B note:

- `claimed_airline`, `claimed_role`, and `claimed_base` remain self-declared
  onboarding/profile fields only.
- Future Home Base state should be treated as optional personalization
  preference in the initial DFW-only rollout, not authorization truth.
- Home Base should not verify employment, airline, role, base assignment, or
  restricted-board eligibility.
- Self-declared airline text may be editable in profile, but future
  airline-specific boards or lounges must rely on verified airline or
  approved-domain logic rather than self-declared airline text.

Important fields:

- id
- user_id
- public_handle
- display_name
- anonymous_handle_seed
- airline_id
- role_id
- base_id
- employment_status
- bio
- is_profile_public
- created_at
- updated_at

Relationships:

- Belongs to User, Airline, Role, and Base.
- Later may have a Home Base preference and board follows used for
  personalization, not authorization.

## Verification

Aviation affiliation review.

Important fields:

- id
- user_id
- tier_requested
- tier_granted
- status
- method
- work_email_domain
- submitted_evidence_path
- evidence_redaction_confirmed
- evidence_expires_at
- reviewer_user_id
- reviewed_at
- rejection_reason
- created_at
- updated_at
- deleted_at

Relationships:

- Belongs to User.
- Reviewed by admin User.
- May create ModerationAction or audit entries.

## Airline

Airline or aviation employer.

Important fields:

- id
- name
- code
- country
- work_email_domains
- is_active
- created_at
- updated_at

Relationships:

- Has many Profiles and Bases.
- Can have CrewRooms.

## Role

Worker role.

Important fields:

- id
- name
- slug
- category
- is_active
- created_at
- updated_at

Examples:

- Flight attendant
- Pilot
- Gate agent
- Ramp agent
- Dispatcher
- Crew scheduler
- Airport operations
- Regional worker
- New hire
- Commuter

## Base

Current T05 implementation note:

- `bases` is implemented as the First-Base MVP base/airport community anchor
  table.
- The T05 runtime apply pass is recorded in
  `docs/ops/fbmvp-t05-base-board-runtime-pass.md`.
- DFW is seeded as the first launch and only live base in the initial rollout,
  but the table is designed for many bases from the start.
- Self-declared profile base text remains separate and must not become
  authorization truth.

Airline base or domicile.

Important fields:

- id
- code
- name
- airport_name
- city
- state
- country
- timezone
- status
- launch_priority
- created_at
- updated_at

Relationships:

- Can anchor many Boards.
- Can be referenced later by profile preferences or follow/home-base state.
- Does not prove a user's role, airline, or restricted-board membership.

## BoardType

Current T05 implementation note:

- `board_types` is implemented as controlled board taxonomy.
- The T05 runtime apply pass records seeded runtime board types for
  `base_board`, `layover_board`, and `verified_lounge`.
- Seeded types are `base_board`, `layover_board`, and `verified_lounge`.
- Verified Lounges are modeled as a board type.
- Board wiki/intel is not a board type; it should be structured content
  attached to boards in a later ticket.

Important fields:

- id
- key
- label
- description
- default_visibility
- default_posting_mode
- display_order
- is_active
- created_at
- updated_at

Relationships:

- Has many Boards.

## Board

Current T05 implementation note:

- `boards` is implemented as the user-facing board-space table.
- DFW Base Board is seeded as the first available board.
- The T05 runtime apply pass confirms the seeded `DFW Base Board` row exists as
  active metadata in the intended Supabase runtime.
- The table is designed for many base boards, layover boards, and restricted
  lounge boards over time.
- The canonical Base Board product definition is in
  `strategy/base-board-product-definition.md`: a Base Board is a hub/container
  for structured base intel, posts, useful/trending knowledge, related Layover
  Boards, and restricted Verified Lounges.
- The canonical Verified Lounge access model is in
  `strategy/verified-lounge-access-model.md`: a Verified Lounge is a
  restricted board associated with a base, role, airline, or other approved
  aviation-worker criteria, with approved membership required before content
  access.
- Posting, comments, follows, memberships, access requests, saves, reactions,
  search, reports, and moderation remain later tickets.
- `strategy/home-base-board-follow-decision.md` defines the T06 product
  boundary: setting Home Base should auto-follow the corresponding main Base
  Board, users may follow many boards, and follows must not grant restricted
  access.

Important fields:

- id
- board_type_id
- base_id
- parent_board_id
- slug
- name
- short_name
- description
- visibility
- posting_mode
- discoverability
- status
- sort_order
- created_at
- updated_at

Relationships:

- Belongs to BoardType.
- May belong to Base.
- May have a parent Board.
- Later has follows, memberships, posts, comments, saves, reactions, reports,
  moderation actions, and search indexing.
- Later has board intel/wiki structured content attached to the board. Board
  intel/wiki is not a board type.

## VerifiedLoungeAccess

Product definition:

- `strategy/verified-lounge-access-model.md` is the canonical product decision
  for Verified Lounge access before implementing the next restricted-access
  ticket.
- A Verified Lounge is modeled as a restricted board associated with a base,
  role, airline, or other approved aviation-worker criteria.
- It is not a public feed, not a direct-message system, and not proof that the
  user works for a specific airline, role, or base.
- Lounge access requires approved membership.
- Home Base, board follows, and self-declared `claimed_airline`,
  `claimed_role`, or `claimed_base` must not grant lounge access.
- Product-facing lounge/community admins are `Crew Leads`. Internally, future
  schema may use neutral names such as `community_admin`, `board_admin`, or
  `board_moderator`.

Future model concepts:

- lounge membership
- lounge access request
- request lifecycle: `not_requested`, `pending`, `approved`, `denied`,
  `revoked`, with optional later `expired` and `withdrawn`
- request thread or request comments scoped to a single access request
- scoped Crew Lead grants for specific lounges/boards
- audit events for request creation, approval, denial, revocation, and request
  messages

Privacy boundaries:

- Crew Leads should see only the minimum data needed to review a request,
  including public handle, display name if used, email domain or verified
  work-email status if available, clearly labeled self-declared profile fields,
  request message, and request history for that lounge.
- Crew Leads should not see proof uploads, private verification artifacts,
  unrelated account security data, unrelated lounge memberships, platform admin
  notes, sensitive internal audit details, exact live location/schedule data,
  or passenger/private company information by default.

Current scope:

- No lounge membership tables are implemented yet.
- No access request tables are implemented yet.
- No request UI or Crew Lead panel exists yet.
- No full direct-message system exists or is implied.
- No proof-upload scope is reintroduced.

## HomeBasePreference

Current T06 implementation note:

`user_home_base_preferences` is added by the T06 migration. The intended
Supabase runtime already has the T06 schema/functions, recorded remotely as
`20260609194858 create_home_base_board_follows`, while the local repo file
remains `20260609130534_create_home_base_board_follows.sql`. Do not re-apply
or retroactively mark the local T06 file; use targeted follow-up migrations for
runtime hardening. The first follow-up is
`20260609200310_harden_home_base_rpc_execute_grants.sql`, which removes `anon`
EXECUTE from the T06 RPCs while preserving authenticated/service-role
execution. The targeted runtime pass is recorded in
`docs/ops/fbmvp-t06-home-base-board-follows-runtime-pass.md`.

Home Base is the user's primary base preference for personalization when the
user chooses one. It is optional in the initial DFW-only rollout and is not
proof of employment, airline, role, base assignment, or restricted-board
eligibility.

Important fields:

- user_id
- base_id
- selected_at
- updated_at

Relationships:

- Belongs to User.
- Belongs to Base.
- The row is set through `set_user_home_base(p_base_code text)`, which requires
  an authenticated user and active base.
- The Home Dashboard uses this preference to decide whether to show the Home
  Base card or the skip-for-now exploratory/default state.

Expected behavior:

- A user may have one current Home Base preference.
- In the initial DFW-only rollout, onboarding should use a DFW-start choice
  rather than a fake one-option Home Base picker.
- In that first rollout, confirming or starting with DFW should set Home Base
  to DFW and ensure the DFW Base Board is followed.
- If the user skips the DFW-start step, no Home Base preference is created and
  no automatic board follow is required.
- No Home Base is a valid initial DFW-only rollout state and must not block app
  access.
- Users without Home Base should later receive an exploratory/default
  experience until they set Home Base or follow boards.
- Setting Home Base should ensure the base's main Base Board is followed.
- Future multi-base rollout should allow selection from active bases and later
  Home Base switching.
- Changing Home Base should keep the old board follow by default unless the
  user manually unfollows it.
- Home Base must not grant Verified Lounge or restricted-board access.

## BoardFollow

Current T06 implementation note:

`board_follows` is added by the T06 migration already present in the intended
Supabase runtime under the remote migration ledger version
`20260609194858 create_home_base_board_follows`. The local repo file remains
`20260609130534_create_home_base_board_follows.sql` and should not be
re-applied or retroactively marked applied. The targeted runtime pass for the
follow-up RPC execute-grant hardening is recorded in
`docs/ops/fbmvp-t06-home-base-board-follows-runtime-pass.md`.

A board follow is a personalization signal, not an access grant.

Users may follow Base Boards, Layover Boards, and Verified Lounges where access
or membership permits. Following a restricted board must not bypass membership,
visibility, posting, moderation, or launch gates.

Important fields:

- id
- user_id
- board_id
- source
- notification_level
- is_favorite
- followed_at
- updated_at

Relationships:

- Belongs to User.
- Belongs to Board.
- Unique per `(user_id, board_id)`.

T06 constrains `source` to `manual`, `home_base`, `onboarding`, or `system`.
It constrains `notification_level` to `default`, `muted`, or `important`.

The T06 Home Base RPC auto-follows the active Base Board for the selected
active base and preserves older follows. Manual follow/unfollow behavior,
favorite editing, restricted lounge follows, notification behavior, and
membership/access approval remain later tickets.

Home Dashboard note:

- `board_follows` initially supports the Following section as followed boards.
- It does not currently represent followed users.
- It does not grant restricted-board access.

Relationships:

- Has many Bases and LayoverBoards.

## CrewRoom

Legacy / broader V1 note:

- The current 05B direction models Base Boards, Layover Boards, and Verified
  Lounges through `boards` plus `board_types`.
- Generic global Crew Rooms remain broader/later-lane planning, not the T05
  schema foundation.

## Subscription

Deferred paid-account or premium-access entity.

V1 status:

- Do not model Subscription in V1 unless payments or premium features are explicitly approved.
- Do not add payment, billing, Stripe customer, or subscription lifecycle fields until Stripe/payments enter scope.
- If premium subscriptions are approved later, model Subscription separately from core verification, trust, and posting access so paid status cannot override safety or verification rules.

## AuditLog

Product/audit abstraction rather than a required standalone V1 table.

V1 strategy:

- Audit requirements should be backed by SecurityEvent, ModerationAction, verification decision history, admin action history, and relevant timestamp/reviewer fields.
- Do not duplicate sensitive logs into a separate AuditLog table unless there is a clear query, retention, compliance, or operational purpose.
- If a distinct AuditLog is added later, it must align with SecurityEvent and ModerationAction semantics and avoid copying raw verification artifacts, private notes, or sensitive content unnecessarily.

## Relationship Summary

- User owns Profile, Verification records, content, saved items, reports, moderation actions, AI briefs, and trust level.
- Profile connects User to Airline, Role, and Base.
- Base connects Airline and Airport.
- CrewRoom can represent airline, role, base, airport, or topic communities.
- Posts belong to CrewRooms; Comments belong to Posts.
- LayoverBoard belongs to Airport and powers layover-specific content and AI briefs.
- Deals belong to Vendors and may be airport-specific.
- Reports and ModerationActions enforce accountability across content and accounts.
- SecurityEvent records sensitive audit trails.
- UploadArtifact separates private file metadata from public profile and content records.
- Subscription is deferred until payments or premium features are explicitly in scope.
- AuditLog is covered by SecurityEvent, ModerationAction, verification decision history, and admin action history unless a later design needs a distinct table.

## Model Boundaries for V1

Do not model airline portal credentials, scraped schedules, live crew locations, flight-load request infrastructure, payments, subscriptions, native mobile device records, or roster/calendar integrations in V1.

## Data Modeling Best Practices

- Prefer explicit enums or constrained values for account_status, verification status, room type, visibility, moderation action type, and report category.
- Use database constraints for critical invariants.
- Keep public profile data separate from private verification data.
- Store only metadata needed for uploaded artifacts; do not store original filenames in clear text if they may contain personal information.
- Make sensitive audit logs append-only in application behavior.
- Design retention fields before launch rather than adding deletion as an afterthought.
