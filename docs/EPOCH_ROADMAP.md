# Epoch Roadmap

Working name note: "Deadhead Club" is a working product name pending legal and trademark clearance. This roadmap does not claim legal or trademark clearance.

Product principle: Utility first. Community second. Social feed last.

Identity principle: Verified privately. Anonymous publicly. Accountable internally.

Deadhead Club is not affiliated with or endorsed by any airline, airport, union, or employer unless explicitly obtained and documented.

## 1. Purpose

This roadmap organizes the existing Deadhead Club planning library into execution epochs. It is the sequencing spine for future founder, product, engineering, design, policy, and Codex work.

Detailed docs remain the source of truth for their domains. This roadmap summarizes controlling decisions, exit criteria, blockers, and next actions without duplicating every detail.

Future Codex tasks must declare which epoch they belong to. Work that does not map to an epoch should be treated as a scope question before implementation begins.

## 2. Current Project State

- Live production site exists: https://deadheadclub.vercel.app.
- Tally waitlist exists: https://tally.so/r/jav6aa.
- Public splash page exists at `/`.
- `/app` private beta placeholder exists.
- Waitlist CTA is wired through `NEXT_PUBLIC_WAITLIST_FORM_URL`.
- No auth, database, Supabase, API persistence, community functionality, AI, payments, analytics SDK, or internal waitlist capture exists.
- Discovery is desk-researched, not fully user-validated.
- FA expert interview remains pending.
- First trusted aviation contact outreach remains pending.
- Current production deployment is recorded in `DEPLOYMENT_RECORD_001.md`.
- Future private-app implementation should follow `SCALABILITY_AND_ARCHITECTURE_REQUIREMENTS.md` so auth, data, moderation, storage, and search decisions remain scale-ready without overbuilding.

## 3. Epoch Status Legend

- Complete: planned scope is delivered and recorded.
- Active: currently being validated, operated, or refined.
- Pending: not started and waiting for prior gates or explicit approval.
- Blocked: cannot proceed until named blockers are resolved.
- Deferred: intentionally later, not part of immediate MVP sequence.
- Future: planned beyond the current MVP/private-beta execution horizon.
- Superseded: replaced by a newer doc, decision, or execution path.

Tracked visual backlog:

- **Replace prior cinematic/globe public waitlist direction with simpler premium static `jmpseat.` waitlist**
  - Status: approved replacement direction.
  - Reason: the older cinematic/globe/terrain public waitlist concept is canceled. The public route should now prioritize a simpler premium static waitlist page with clearer conversion and less implementation risk.
  - Target: the production public `/` route.
  - Requirements:
    - Mobile-first static page.
    - Dark premium aviation styling.
    - External waitlist handoff remains intact.
    - No 3D, globe, WebGL, cinematic scroll sequence, or transformation choreography.
    - Must preserve accessibility, privacy-safe waitlist copy, and the public/private route boundary.
    - Must not add auth, database, API persistence, verification, community features, AI, payments, or other product features as part of the redesign.
  - Operating rule: this public redesign remains separate from Epoch 03/auth and from the private `/app` shell.

- Review the live site on mobile.
- Send the live site to 3-5 trusted aviation contacts.
- Conduct the FA expert interview when available.
- Capture feedback and update `PROBLEM_SOLUTION_VALIDATION_MATRIX.md`.
- Only then decide whether to proceed to Epoch 02 / M1B private app shell.

## 8. Codex Workflow Rules by Epoch

- Every task must declare its epoch.
- Use one branch per bounded slice.
- Plan/Goals are required for multi-step tasks.
- No app feature work without explicit approval.
- No app feature work without scoped branch, acceptance criteria, and proof.
- Final reports must include branch, commit, files changed, checks run, and scope confirmation.
- No merge to `main` without review.
- V1 scope exclusions remain in force unless a later reviewed epoch explicitly reopens them.

## 9. What Must Not Be Built Yet

- Auth.
- Database.
- Supabase.
- Internal waitlist capture.
- Verification uploads.
- Real anonymous posting.
- Crew Rooms functionality.
- Base Boards functionality.

## 10. Roadmap Maintenance Rules

- Update this roadmap when an epoch starts, completes, or changes status.
- Do not let older "Recommended Next Task" sections override this roadmap.
- Detailed docs remain source-of-truth for their domain.
- This roadmap controls sequencing.
- If roadmap and older docs conflict, pause and update the roadmap or the stale source doc before implementation.

## 11. Recommended Next Codex Task

Recommended next task: `docs: record initial trusted-contact feedback after outreach`.

Use Plan/Goals: yes.

If the FA expert interview happens first, use: `docs: update validation matrix after FA expert interview`.

Do not start app feature work as the immediate next task unless explicitly approved.
