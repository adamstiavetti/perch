# Epoch Roadmap

Brand note: jmpseat is the canonical product and app name. This document does not claim legal or trademark clearance for the name.
Rename note: Deadhead Club is retired and should not be used in current docs, UI, code, or planning. Older Git history may still contain legacy references.

Product principle: Utility first. Community second. Social feed last.

Identity principle: Verified privately. Anonymous publicly. Accountable internally.

jmpseat is not affiliated with or endorsed by any airline, airport, union, or employer unless explicitly obtained and documented.

## 1. Purpose

This roadmap organizes the existing jmpseat planning library into execution epochs. It is the sequencing spine for future founder, product, engineering, design, policy, and Codex work.

Detailed docs remain the source of truth for their domains. This roadmap summarizes controlling decisions, exit criteria, blockers, and next actions without duplicating every detail.

Future Codex tasks must declare which epoch they belong to. Work that does not map to an epoch should be treated as a scope question before implementation begins.

## 2. Current Project State

- Live production site exists: https://jmpseat.vercel.app.
- Tally waitlist exists: https://tally.so/r/jav6aa.
- Public splash page exists at `/`.
- `/app` private beta shell exists behind auth/profile/beta gates.
- `/app/admin` safe shell exists, reads explicit operator grants as authorization metadata, and keeps unimplemented operator-only sections disabled until their tooling pages exist.
- Operator grants foundation exists, the first operator bootstrap runtime pass is complete, approved-domain management is implemented and runtime-proven, reviewer-scope management is implemented and runtime-proven, verification audit inspection is implemented and runtime-proven, proof cleanup monitoring is implemented and runtime-proven, and protected manual proof cleanup controls are implemented and runtime-proven.
- Waitlist CTA is wired through `NEXT_PUBLIC_WAITLIST_FORM_URL`.
- Supabase-backed auth, profiles, beta access, verification, claims, reviewer queue, proof storage, proof viewing, and proof cleanup foundations exist.
- Product direction has pivoted: forward app-level access should use confirmed approved airline employee email control, and restricted role/base board access should be community-admin managed rather than based on jmpseat proof-upload review. Proof upload is frozen as a forward product path, First-Base MVP scope is defined as the first complete base launch package, community-admin responsibilities/disclaimers are defined, the private-testing-to-first-base-launch gate transition is defined, beta invite codes are defined as private-testing capacity control only, and the First-Base MVP implementation ticket pack now defines the forward `FBMVP` sequence. `FBMVP-T01` freezes normal user-facing proof upload surfaces; `FBMVP-T02` adds the airline-email access-state helper/adapter; `FBMVP-T03` adds explicit launch-mode app access gates; `FBMVP-T03A` defines beta invite-code foundation before onboarding/signup work. See `strategy/product-pivot-email-verification-community-boards.md`, `strategy/airline-email-access-gate-decision.md`, `strategy/board-community-access-model-decision.md`, `strategy/proof-system-freeze-deprecation-plan.md`, `strategy/first-base-mvp-scope.md`, `strategy/community-admin-responsibilities-disclaimer-policy.md`, `strategy/launch-readiness-gate-transition-plan.md`, `strategy/beta-invite-code-foundation-decision.md`, `epochs/first-base-mvp-implementation-ticket-pack.md`, `epochs/fbmvp-t01-freeze-user-facing-proof-verification-surfaces.md`, `epochs/fbmvp-t02-airline-email-verification-access-state-design.md`, `epochs/fbmvp-t02-airline-email-verification-access-state-implementation.md`, and `epochs/fbmvp-t03-private-testing-versus-first-base-launch-gate-implementation.md`.
- No community functionality, AI product feature, payments, analytics SDK, or internal waitlist capture exists.
- Discovery is desk-researched, not fully user-validated.
- FA expert interview remains pending.
- First trusted aviation contact outreach remains pending.
- Current production deployment is recorded in `DEPLOYMENT_RECORD_001.md`.
- Future private-app implementation should continue following `SCALABILITY_AND_ARCHITECTURE_REQUIREMENTS.md` so auth, data, moderation, storage, and search decisions remain scale-ready without overbuilding.
- Future private-app implementation should continue following `MOBILE_APP_STRATEGY.md` so the web MVP does not create backend, auth, verification, or authorization decisions that block a later native mobile client.

## 3. Epoch Status Legend

- Complete: planned scope is delivered and recorded.
- Active: currently being validated, operated, or refined.
- Pending: not started and waiting for prior gates or explicit approval.
- Blocked: cannot proceed until named blockers are resolved.
- Deferred: intentionally later, not part of immediate MVP sequence.
- Future: planned beyond the current MVP/private-beta execution horizon.
- Superseded: replaced by a newer doc, decision, or execution path.

## 5. Required Epochs

### Epoch 00 - Discovery & Problem/Solution Validation

Status: active / partially complete.

Purpose:

- Validate the problem.
- Validate target audience.
- Validate product wedge.
- Validate trust and safety concerns.
- Validate first beta community.

Primary docs:

- `DISCOVERY_RESEARCH_PLAN.md`

- `M0_VALIDATION_OPERATING_PACKET.md`
- `PRODUCT_DELIVERY_OPERATING_MODEL.md`

Current truth:

- Desk research supports continuing.
- Strongest wedge is Base Boards + Layover Boards + verified anonymous rooms.
- FA expert interview is pending.
- Real user interviews are pending.
- Trusted aviation contact feedback is pending.

Exit criteria:

- FA expert interview completed and recorded.
- At least 3-5 trusted aviation contacts review the live site.
- Initial feedback captured.
- Validation matrix updated.
- No major trust/safety contradiction discovered.

### Epoch 01 - Public Splash + Waitlist

Status: complete / live.

Purpose:

Primary docs:

- `APP_FOUNDATION_NOTES.md`
- `LANDING_PAGE_WAITLIST_PLAN.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_AND_WAITLIST_READINESS.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_RECORD_001.md`

Current truth:

- Live production URL: https://jmpseat.vercel.app.
- Tally URL: https://tally.so/r/jav6aa.
- CTA is wired through `NEXT_PUBLIC_WAITLIST_FORM_URL`.
- `/app` remains placeholder only.
- The near-term product remains web-first; native mobile is a later client, not a current implementation target.

- M1A public splash/waitlist app foundation.
- Production deployment record.
- External waitlist CTA configuration.

Pending:

- Submit and verify a non-sensitive Tally test response.
- Review mobile UX.
- Record first trusted-contact feedback.

Tracked visual backlog:

- **Replace prior cinematic/globe public waitlist direction with simpler premium static `jmpseat.` waitlist**
  - Status: approved replacement direction.
  - Reason: the older cinematic/globe/terrain public waitlist concept is canceled. The public route should now prioritize a simpler premium static waitlist page with clearer conversion and less implementation risk.
  - Target: the production public `/` route.
  - Requirements:
    - Mobile-first static page.
    - Dark premium aviation styling.
    - External waitlist handoff remains intact.
    - No 3D, globe, WebGL, cinematic scroll sequence, or transformation choreography.
    - Must preserve accessibility, privacy-safe waitlist copy, and the public/private route boundary.
    - Must not add auth, database, API persistence, verification, community features, AI, payments, or other product features as part of the redesign.
  - Operating rule: this public redesign remains separate from Epoch 03/auth and from the private `/app` shell.

Exit criteria:

- Production loads.
- CTA opens Tally.
- Fallback removed.
- Tally test response submitted and verified.
- Mobile page reviewed.

### Epoch 02 - Private App Foundation

Status: pending.

Purpose:

Primary docs:

- `PRIVATE_APP_AUTH_DB_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `NAMING_AND_INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `MILESTONE_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
- `TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`

Exit criteria:

- Private app shell exists.
- Route structure defined.
- No unauthorized access.
- No real community functionality yet.

Blockers:

- Explicit approval required.
- M0 validation signal preferred first.

### Epoch 03 - Auth, Profiles, and Beta Access

- `SCALABILITY_AND_ARCHITECTURE_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `MOBILE_APP_STRATEGY.md`

Exit criteria:

- Auth implemented.
- Beta access state exists.
- Invited users can enter.
- Non-invited users are blocked.
- Auth remains separate from aviation verification.
- Auth, profile, beta-access, authorization, pagination, indexing, and private-data handling choices remain scale-ready for tens of thousands of registered users without unnecessary overengineering.
- Auth, account-state, authorization, and data-access choices avoid web-only assumptions that would block a future native mobile client.

### Epoch 04 - Worker Verification Foundation

Status: complete.

Purpose:

- implement worker-verification foundation and review workflow
- support initial approved methods: airline work-email verification where available and redacted badge/proof upload with human review
- produce approved worker claims that later room and private-area authorization can use
- preserve privacy, auditability, and retention/deletion controls while avoiding legally risky verification behavior

- Approved-domain review path exists.
- Redacted proof upload/storage exists with private bucket controls.
- Controlled reviewer proof viewing exists.
- Proof retention/deletion cleanup helper and protected cleanup routes exist.
- AI cannot approve verification.

Delivered workflow slice:

- email-domain verification for approved airline/employer domains
- redacted badge/proof upload
- private storage and controlled reviewer access
- human review
- approved claims for airline-worker and airline where supported by the current bounded paths
- retention and deletion controls for raw proof

Explicit prohibitions:

- no employer-system lookup unless explicit written authorization exists
- no AI final approval
- no scraping private airline systems or private groups
- no employee database lookup

Important follow-up preserved for later ops/brand work:

- customize Supabase auth email templates for jmpseat branding
- configure custom SMTP/domain sender so confirmation and reset emails do not look third-party
- add approved-domain operator tooling
- add reviewer-scope operator tooling
- add cleanup monitoring and alerting
- finalize production privacy/legal copy

### Epoch 05 - Operator/Admin Tooling Foundation

- Epoch 08 and Epoch 09 are deferred until core value is proven.

## 7. Current Recommended Next Actions

- Use `strategy/product-pivot-email-verification-community-boards.md` as the forward product-direction source of truth.
- Use `strategy/airline-email-access-gate-decision.md` as the forward app-level access-gate source of truth.
- Use `strategy/board-community-access-model-decision.md` as the forward board/community access source of truth.
- Use `strategy/proof-system-freeze-deprecation-plan.md` as the forward proof-system freeze/deprecation source of truth.
- Use `strategy/first-base-mvp-scope.md` as the First-Base MVP launch-package source of truth.
- Use `strategy/community-admin-responsibilities-disclaimer-policy.md` as the community-admin responsibilities, limits, privacy, disclaimer, and abuse-control source of truth.
- Use `strategy/launch-readiness-gate-transition-plan.md` as the private-testing beta gate to first-base launch gate transition source of truth.
- Use `strategy/beta-invite-code-foundation-decision.md` as the private-testing beta invite-code source of truth.
- Use `epochs/first-base-mvp-implementation-ticket-pack.md` as the forward First-Base MVP implementation ticket sequence.
- Do not start E05-T08 until pivot planning is complete.
- Do not expand proof-upload verification unless explicitly instructed.
- E05-T07 runtime proof is committed on `main`; older or parallel branches with
  uncommitted E05-T07 proof docs should finish that handoff before pivot work.
- Continue the FBMVP sequence with `FBMVP-T03A Beta Invite-Code Foundation` before `FBMVP-T04 Onboarding/Signup Flow Update`; content/moderation policy can still be refined before live community launch if needed.
- Continue product validation outreach in parallel:
  - submit and verify a Tally test response if not already recorded
  - review the live site on mobile
  - send the live site to 3-5 trusted aviation contacts
  - conduct the FA expert interview when available
  - capture feedback and update `PROBLEM_SOLUTION_VALIDATION_MATRIX.md`

## 8. Codex Workflow Rules by Epoch

- Every task must declare its epoch.
- Use one branch per bounded slice.
- Plan/Goals are required for multi-step tasks.
- No app feature work without explicit approval.
- No app feature work without scoped branch, acceptance criteria, and proof.
- Final reports must include branch, commit, files changed, checks run, and scope confirmation.
- No merge to `main` without review.
- V1 scope exclusions remain in force unless a later reviewed epoch explicitly reopens them.

## 9. What Must Not Be Built Yet

- Real anonymous posting.
- Crew Rooms functionality beyond explicitly scoped claim-gated structure.
- Base Boards functionality beyond explicitly scoped claim-gated structure.
- Layover Boards functionality beyond explicitly scoped claim-gated structure.
- AI product features or AI verification approval.
- Payments.
- Marketplace.
- Nearby crew tracking.
- Schedule import.
- Airline portal login.
- Employer-system lookup.
- Non-rev load requests.
- Dating/swiping.

## 10. Roadmap Maintenance Rules

- Update this roadmap when an epoch starts, completes, or changes status.
- Do not let older "Recommended Next Task" sections override this roadmap.
- Detailed docs remain source-of-truth for their domain.
- This roadmap controls sequencing.
- If roadmap and older docs conflict, pause and update the roadmap or the stale source doc before implementation.

## 11. Recommended Next Codex Task

Recommended next task: `FBMVP-T03A Beta Invite-Code Foundation`.

Use Plan/Goals: yes.

Do not start E05-T08, proof-upload expansion, proof-cleanup expansion, or
community board implementation until the pivot planning docs are reviewed.
