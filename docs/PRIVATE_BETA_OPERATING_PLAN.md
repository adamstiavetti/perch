# Private Beta Operating Plan

Brand note: jmpseat is the canonical product and app name. This document does not claim legal or trademark clearance for the name.

Product principle: Utility first. Community second. Social feed last.

Identity principle: Verified privately. Anonymous publicly. Accountable internally.

This is a documentation-only operating plan. It does not scaffold app code or expand V1 scope.

Current scope note:

- This operating plan remains a broader/full private-beta target reference.
- It should not be read as meaning the current product is already ready for
  real private beta users.
- Use `docs/ops/private-beta-readiness-bridge.md` for the immediate narrow
  post-Epoch-5 readiness lane.
- Use `docs/ops/05b-first-base-mvp-planning.md` for the controlling first-05B
  implementation sequence.
- Current private beta / 05B direction does not use proof uploads. Work-email
  verification and private beta access gates are the active verification path.
  Manual-proof, badge-upload, or document-upload workflows would require a fresh
  scope decision plus privacy/security review before activation.
- DFW is the first launch base and DFW Base Board is the first available base
  board. DFW is not the whole product concept; the model should support many
  bases, base boards, layover boards, Verified Lounges / restricted role-based
  spaces, follows, posts, comments, saves, reactions/useful marks, and
  access-aware search over time.
- For the first implementation sequence, keep proof uploads, manual
  proof/document uploads, generic social-feed work, generic global Crew Rooms
  expansion, media/upload posting, AI auto-publishing, deals, full mobile scope,
  and anonymous posting unless separately approved out of scope.
- Current focused policy/ops audit:
  `docs/ops/private-beta-policy-ops-readiness-audit.md` records the
  post-DFW-Hub-baseline readiness state. DFW Today/Base/Layover and Channels
  create/read/report/moderation foundation are smoked, but broader private-beta
  use still needs beta terms/privacy/community-rules copy, work-email
  verification consent copy, support/contact routing, incident/escalation
  ownership, moderation/appeals runbooks, deletion/export request process, and
  token/access hygiene review.
- Policy/Ops Pack v1:
  `docs/ops/policy-ops-pack-v1-summary.md` now collects draft private-beta
  terms, privacy notice, community rules, verification consent copy, moderation
  and appeals runbooks, support/incident/deletion operations, and operator
  moderation guidance. These are product-ready drafts for founder/legal review;
  app wiring, policy acceptance, footer/onboarding/posting/reporting links, and
  final legal approval remain separate work before broader private-beta use.
- Policy/Ops Pack v1 UI wiring:
  `docs/ops/policy-ops-pack-v1-ui-wiring.md` adds read-only `/legal/...`
  private-beta policy pages plus focused links from the public waitlist, auth
  entry, access-hold verification copy, DFW Channel composer/reporting, and
  admin moderation surfaces. Policy acceptance, support form backend,
  deletion/export intake, appeal intake, final contact paths, and final legal
  approval remain unwired. Browser smoke is recorded in
  `docs/ops/policy-ops-pack-v1-ui-wiring-browser-smoke.md`; public legal
  routes and linked surfaces tested passed, with access-hold and operator-admin
  checks limited by the active session state.

## 1. Purpose

The private beta exists to validate whether a small, verified aviation-worker community can create useful base intel, layover knowledge, anonymous but accountable crew discussion, and crew-friendly recommendations in a safe environment.

The beta is not a public launch. It is a controlled validation period for:

- Product utility: do airline people return because the product helps them solve practical problems?
- Safety: can the product prevent or quickly handle aviation-sensitive content?
- Verification: can users complete verification without excessive friction or privacy concern?
- Community seeding: can the first rooms feel useful before broad growth?
- Moderation load: can the founder/admin team operate the product without being overwhelmed?

The beta should not test excluded V1 features such as airline portal login, schedule scraping, public nearby crew tracking, dating/swiping, exact public crew hotel exposure, flight-load requests, native mobile, full marketplace payments, advanced employment verification APIs, or roster/calendar integrations.

## 2. Beta Success Criteria

Private beta success should be measured by utility, trust, and repeat use rather than vanity activity.

Minimum viable community density:

- 50 invited users.
- 35 accepted invitations.
- 25 verified users.
- 15 users active in the first 7 days.
- 8 users who post or comment at least once.
- 5 users who save content or use search.

Activation:

- At least 70% of invited users create an account.
- At least 60% of account creators complete verification or reach pending verification.
- At least 70% of verified users create a profile with airline, role, base, and public handle.

Retention:

- At least 40% of verified users return within 7 days.
- At least 25% of verified users return in week 2.
- At least 10 users use a utility feature more than once: search, save, Base Board, Layover Board, or Jumpseat Brief.

Post activity:

- At least 20 member-generated posts or comments in the first two weeks.
- At least 10 posts/comments must be utility-oriented, not purely social.
- At least 5 useful Base Board contributions.
- At least 5 useful Layover Board contributions.

Verification completion:

- Median verification review time under 24 hours during active admin coverage.
- Fewer than 20% of users abandon because the verification path feels confusing.
- No unresolved verification privacy incidents; if a future reviewed upload
  workflow accepts artifacts, no unresolved artifact privacy incidents.

Moderation load:

- All reports reviewed within 24 hours during private beta.
- Emergency reports reviewed same day.
- No unresolved passenger privacy, exact crew hotel, airport security, or live operations-sensitive exposure after admin review.

Qualitative feedback:

- At least 10 structured feedback responses.
- At least 6 users can name a specific way jmpseat was useful.
- Fewer than 3 users say they primarily want excluded risky features such as public crew tracking, flight-load requests, dating/swiping, or schedule import.

## 3. First Beta Community Strategy

jmpseat should start with one focused community instead of launching everywhere. A narrow beta creates enough density for useful answers, gives admins a manageable moderation surface, and makes product learning clearer.

Options:

- One airline + one base: highest trust and shared context, but may be too narrow if recruiting enough roles is hard.
- One base across multiple roles: best fit for Base Board utility, commuter knowledge, layover adjacency, and broader airline ecosystem inclusion.
- One role across multiple bases: useful for role-specific pain, but weaker for base-specific institutional knowledge.

Recommendation: start with one base across multiple roles.

Why:

- Base-specific institutional knowledge is a core product asset.
- A base naturally includes flight attendants, pilots, gate agents, ramp agents, schedulers, ops, commuters, and new hires.
- It validates the broader-airline-ecosystem positioning from day one.
- It creates practical content around parking, commuting, reserve life, crash pad discussion, food, transit, errands, and base culture.
- It avoids looking like a single-role social app.

Initial base selection criteria:

- Founder or ambassador has real access to trusted aviation workers at the base.
- At least 5 potential ambassadors or high-trust contributors are reachable before launch.
- The base has enough commuter, layover, or new-hire complexity to make utility obvious.
- The base has multiple roles represented.
- The base does not require exact crew hotel information to be useful.

Unresolved decision:

- Target first base/community is not yet selected.

## 4. First 50 User Plan

The first 50 users should be recruited manually. Do not use broad public ads for private beta.

Target mix:

- 18 flight attendants.
- 8 pilots.
- 7 gate agents.
- 6 ramp agents.
- 5 dispatchers, schedulers, or airport ops workers if available.
- 4 regional airline workers, commuters, or new hires.
- 2 flexible slots for strong ambassadors or trusted connectors.

Ambassador targets:

- 2 flight attendant ambassadors.
- 1 pilot ambassador.
- 1 gate or ramp ambassador.
- 1 dispatcher, scheduler, ops, or regional worker ambassador.
- 1 commuter/new-hire connector if available.

Outreach channels:

- Direct personal outreach from founder or trusted ambassadors.
- Existing aviation friendships and group chats.
- Base-specific offline relationships.
- Small invite-only messages in trusted communities where allowed.
- One-on-one outreach to people known for helpful base or layover knowledge.

Screening criteria:

- Current or recent aviation worker.
- Willing to verify privately.
- Understands that private beta is a test, not a finished public product.
- Agrees not to post passenger private information, exact crew hotel exposure, airport security procedures, live operations-sensitive information, or confidential company documents.
- Willing to contribute at least one useful post, comment, or feedback item.
- Not primarily seeking dating, public crew tracking, flight-load requests, or schedule-import features.

Invite pacing:

- Wave 1: 10 ambassadors and trusted contributors.
- Wave 2: 20 additional users after seed content and moderation workflow are confirmed.
- Wave 3: 20 additional users after the first week if verification and moderation load are manageable.

## 5. Ambassador Program

Ambassadors are trusted early users who help seed utility and model the right behavior. They are not automatic moderators.

Responsibilities:

- Contribute useful Base Board and Layover Board posts.
- Welcome new beta users.
- Model safe anonymous discussion norms.
- Flag missing categories or confusing workflows.
- Report policy issues instead of escalating publicly.
- Invite high-quality users through controlled referral.
- Provide weekly feedback.

Ambassadors should not:

- Approve verification.
- Access private identity or verification artifacts.
- Make moderation decisions.
- Pressure users to meet up.
- Promote vendors without disclosure.
- Post exact crew hotel details.
- Represent themselves as legal, HR, union, or company authority unless that role is explicit and relevant.

Incentives:

- Early premium access later, if premium launches.
- Recognition in private beta notes or founder updates.
- Limited invite privileges.
- Input on roadmap priorities.
- No cash bounty tied to user volume or moderation outcomes.

Avoid incentives that create conflicts:

- No payment per invited user.
- No moderation authority as a reward.
- No vendor/sponsored deal commission during private beta.

## 6. Verification Process for Private Beta

Accepted verification methods:

- Basic email verification.
- Aviation work email verification where the user is comfortable using it.
- Tier 3 manual verification through non-upload manual review when upload controls are not ready.
- Manual badge/document upload verification is deprecated/out of current scope;
  any future reactivation would be a controlled exception after a fresh scope
  decision, privacy/security review, and upload safety validation.
- Founder/admin-known verification for a limited number of trusted first-wave users.
- Peer vouching only as a supplemental signal, not as the sole verification method for unknown users.

Decision on manual badge/document uploads:

- Manual badge/document uploads are not part of the current private beta / 05B
  path.
- Existing proof-upload hardening remains historically documented. If
  proof-upload code, storage, or artifacts still exist, they remain subject to
  private storage, upload validation, short-lived admin links, access logging,
  and deletion-after-review expectations.
- The active path uses work-email verification, private beta access gates,
  founder/admin-known verification where appropriate, non-upload manual review,
  live call review, or non-stored visual confirmation that does not retain
  artifacts.
- Badge uploads, IDs, schedules, or other sensitive verification documents must not be collected on the public waitlist page.

Minimum-safe handling rules if uploads are allowed:

- Tell users what to redact before upload.
- Accept only approved file types and size limits.
- Store only in private storage.
- Rename files on storage.
- Do not serve files from public paths.
- Use short-lived admin links.
- Log admin access.
- Never send verification documents to AI systems.
- Delete artifacts after review under the retention policy.

Verification review steps:

1. User creates account and verifies basic email.
2. User selects verification method.
3. User sees privacy caveat for work email, non-upload manual review, or upload method.
4. User submits verification.
5. Admin reviews only the minimum necessary information.
6. Admin approves, rejects, or requests more information.
7. System records method, status, reviewer, timestamp, and tier.
8. If a future reviewed upload workflow is active, raw artifact is deleted
   after review unless a documented safety/fraud reason requires temporary
   retention.
9. User receives outcome.

## 7. Verification Artifact Retention Decision

Private-beta retention policy recommendation:

- Delete raw verification artifacts after review, preferably immediately after decision and no later than 7 days after submission.
- Retain verification metadata needed for trust and audit: user ID, method, tier granted, reviewer, decision, timestamp, and redaction confirmation.
- Do not retain original filenames in clear text.
- Do not retain unnecessary personal data from badge/document images.
- If a submission is tied to fraud, impersonation, safety risk, or abuse investigation, retain only the minimum necessary metadata and document the reason.
- If a raw artifact must be temporarily retained for safety/fraud review, set an explicit expiration date and owner.

Artifact deletion is different from verification-status retention:

- Artifact deletion removes the uploaded evidence file.
- Verification-status retention keeps the account's verification state and review history.

Open legal/privacy review note:

- The exact retention period and language must be reviewed by the owner of privacy policy / terms before real users submit documents.

## 8. Seed Content Plan

The beta should not feel empty. Seed content should model the utility-first culture and make it clear what belongs in each space.

Minimum seed content before inviting Wave 1:

- 6 Crew Room posts.
- 12 Base Board posts.
- 10 Layover Board posts.
- 3 Jumpseat Brief examples.
- 4 trust and safety pinned posts.
- 3 welcome/onboarding posts.
- 3 NonRev Deals entries if deals are included in the beta.

Crew Rooms examples:

- "What this room is for and what does not belong here."
- "Introduce your role/base without sharing private trip details."
- "The Galley: off-duty discussion rules."
- "Ramp Talk: gate/ramp/ops discussion without live operations-sensitive details."
- "Ready Room: career and interview questions."
- "Crew Rest: sleep, downtime, and wellness."

Base Board examples:

- "First-week base survival guide."
- "Commuter parking and transit overview."
- "Reserve life basics."
- "Food and errands near base."
- "Crash pad discussion rules: no resident rosters, no exact unsafe exposure."
- "New-hire questions thread."
- "Base culture and unwritten tips."
- "What not to post: hotel, passenger, security, and live ops examples."

Layover Board examples:

- "Best quick meals near the airport."
- "Safe transportation options."
- "Quiet places for downtime."
- "Sleep and recovery tips."
- "Gym/walkability notes."
- "Late-night food without naming crew hotels."
- "Airport-area errands."
- "Local safety notes."

Jumpseat Brief examples:

- A 10-hour layover food/rest brief.
- A rainy-day downtime brief.
- A late-arrival transportation and food brief.

Trust and safety pinned posts:

- No passenger private information.
- No exact crew hotel exposure.
- No airport security procedures or live operations-sensitive information.
- Anonymous but accountable identity explainer.

Welcome/onboarding posts:

- "Start here: what jmpseat is."
- "How verification and anonymity work."
- "How to report safety or privacy issues."

## 9. Moderation Runbook

Daily admin checks:

- Review new verification submissions.
- Review reports.
- Review automated risk flags.
- Review new posts in high-risk areas.
- Check for passenger private information.
- Check for exact hotel exposure.
- Check for live operations-sensitive information.
- Check for airport security procedure content.
- Check vendor/deal submissions or mentions.
- Respond to user support messages.

Report handling:

1. Open report.
2. Confirm target content, author, reporter category, and room rules.
3. Check author history and trust level.
4. Classify severity.
5. Dismiss, remove, warn, restrict, suspend, or escalate.
6. Record moderation action and internal note.
7. Notify user when appropriate.

Emergency escalation:

- Trigger for credible threats, passenger private information exposure, exact crew hotel exposure, airport security procedures, live operations-sensitive information, doxxing, or severe harassment.
- Hide/remove content first when exposure risk is immediate.
- Preserve internal audit record.
- Notify designated beta safety owner.
- Document timeline and resolution.

Takedown workflow:

- Remove or hide content from ordinary users.
- Record reason and moderator/admin.
- Notify author unless doing so would worsen safety risk.
- Mark whether appeal is available.

Appeal workflow:

- Private beta appeals can be manual.
- Appeals should be reviewed by someone other than the original moderator where possible.
- Appeals should not restore content that exposes passengers, hotels, security procedures, live operations, doxxing, threats, or confidential documents.

Sensitive aviation/security content:

- Passenger private information: remove immediately.
- Airport security procedures: remove immediately and escalate.
- Live operations-sensitive information: remove immediately and escalate.
- Exact crew hotel exposure: remove immediately and warn or restrict depending on severity.
- Confidential company documents: remove unless explicitly public/allowed.
- Doxxing, threats, harassment, impersonation: remove and apply strike/restriction/suspension as appropriate.

Must be manually reviewed:

- Verification approvals/rejections.
- Final bans or suspensions.
- Appeals.
- Emergency escalations.
- Vendor/deal approval.
- AI safety flags involving sensitive aviation categories.

## 10. AI Beta Rules

Enabled AI features:

- Jumpseat Brief may be enabled in private beta if server-side calls, safety filtering, structured outputs where practical, and logging are ready.

Recommendation:

- Launch Jumpseat Brief as live but limited for Wave 1, not demo-only, if safety checks are in place.
- If safety checks are not ready, use curated demo examples only until live generation is safe.

AI logging/review expectations:

- Log brief type, model, source scope, safety flags, refusal state, and timestamp.
- Avoid retaining sensitive prompt text unless needed for debugging and covered by privacy policy.
- Review a sample of early Jumpseat Brief outputs manually.
- Test prompts for hotel exposure, passenger data, airport security, live operations, and confidential documents.

AI cannot:

- Auto-post on behalf of users.
- Verify users.
- Ban users.
- Issue final moderation decisions.
- Expose sensitive/private data.
- Provide aviation security procedures.
- Override deterministic safety rules.

## 11. Crash Pad Listings Decision

Decision: crash pad listings are Phase 2, not V1 private beta.

Conservative rationale:

- Scam risk.
- Housing disputes.
- Personal safety concerns.
- Location sensitivity.
- Payment and refund complications.
- Moderation burden.
- Risk of exposing resident rosters or exact private addresses.

V1 private beta alternative:

- Allow lightweight discussion-only crash pad guidance inside Base Board.
- Do not allow paid listings.
- Do not allow exact resident rosters.
- Do not allow public exact addresses.
- Do not allow marketplace-style booking or payments.
- Encourage general safety tips, questions to ask, commute considerations, and scam-warning patterns.

## 12. Legal / Policy Pre-Beta Needs

Minimum legal/policy docs needed before real users:

- Terms of service.
- Privacy policy.
- Community guidelines.
- Verification consent language.
- AI disclaimer.
- Name/trademark clearance path for the jmpseat working name.

Required owner/review:

- Founder owns initial policy drafting.
- Legal/privacy reviewer should review terms, privacy policy, verification consent, retention language, and working-name risk.
- Product/admin owner should review community guidelines and moderation runbook.

Do not claim:

- Do not claim legal or trademark clearance unless confirmed by counsel.
- Do not claim employment verification is official airline verification.
- Do not claim AI output is authoritative, legal advice, safety advice, or company policy.

## 14. Kill / Pivot Criteria

The beta is not working if:

- Fewer than 40% of invited users create accounts.
- Fewer than 50% of account creators attempt verification.
- Users repeatedly refuse verification because privacy concerns are unresolved.
- Fewer than 8 users post or comment in the first two weeks.
- Users do not return after first visit.
- Most activity is casual/social and not utility-oriented.
- Users primarily ask for excluded features such as flight-load requests, public crew tracking, dating/swiping, schedule scraping, or roster import.
- Moderation requires more admin time than the team can sustain.
- Serious safety incidents recur despite policy and moderation.
- Jumpseat Brief repeatedly produces unsafe or low-value output.
- Base Board and Layover Board content does not become reusable knowledge.

Pivot options:

- Narrow to a smaller base/community.
- Shift from broad community to Base Board / Layover Board utility first.
- Delay AI until content quality improves.
- Delay manual uploads and use work email/manual non-upload verification.
- Pause beta until trust and safety operations are stronger.

## 15. Recommended Next Build Step

Do not scaffold the app yet unless explicitly approved.

Recommended next Codex task:

- Execute M0 validation/no-code waitlist preparation: finalize the waitlist tool choice, privacy-safe form fields, outreach list, interview script, ambassador screening flow, and data handling owner.

Alternative documentation-only task:

- Create a counsel/security review packet covering trademark/name clearance, privacy, verification consent, manual upload handling, AI notice, incident response, and vendor disclosure.

## Unresolved Decisions

- Target first base/community.
- First 50 beta users.
- Ambassador roster.
- Exact verification-document retention period after legal/privacy review.
- Confirm that private beta uses work-email verification/private-access gates
  and non-upload manual review only. Any manual badge/document upload workflow
  requires a fresh scope decision plus privacy/security review.
- Policy owner for terms, privacy policy, community guidelines, verification consent, and AI disclaimer.
- Legal/trademark clearance path for the jmpseat working name.
