# Epoch 04: Worker Verification Foundation Ticket Pack

Brand note: jmpseat is the canonical product and app name. This document does not claim legal or trademark clearance for the name.

Product principle: Utility first. Community second. Social feed last.

Identity principle: Verified privately. Anonymous publicly. Accountable internally.

## 1. Executive Summary

Epoch 04 is the **Worker Verification Foundation** epoch.

Its purpose is to build the first real verification foundation for confirming that users are airline workers while preserving privacy, minimizing sensitive data collection, and avoiding legally risky verification methods.

Epoch 04 must keep verification separate from:

- public waitlist capture
- Supabase auth identity
- profile completion
- beta access
- future moderation/admin role systems

Epoch 04 should be implemented in bounded slices. It must not drift into community features, payments, full moderation operations, mobile scaffolding, or generalized admin-product work.

## 2. Relationship To Epoch 03

Epoch 03 established:

- auth foundation
- account/profile foundation
- beta-access foundation
- private-app access gates
- authorization/security-event baseline

Epoch 04 builds on that base by adding worker-verification state, evidence handling rules, human review design, and claims-based authorization preparation.

Epoch 04 must preserve all existing Epoch 03 boundaries:

- auth is not verification
- profile completion is not verification
- beta approval is not verification
- self-declared airline, role, and base fields are not verified claims

## 3. Purpose Of Epoch 04

Epoch 04 is intended to:

- define and implement the worker-verification claim model
- define and implement verification request/evidence metadata foundations
- support the initial approved verification methods
- prepare `/app/verification` as the user-facing verification submission/status surface
- define or implement a bounded human-review foundation
- prepare claims-based authorization for later rooms/boards
- preserve privacy, auditability, and retention/deletion controls

Initial approved verification methods remain:

1. airline work-email verification where available
2. redacted badge/proof upload with human review

Additional hard rules:

- AI may assist later only as advisory pre-check, not final approval
- employer-system lookup is prohibited unless jmpseat has explicit written employer authorization
- future room/private access must rely on approved claims, not self-declared profile fields

## 4. What Epoch 04 Is

Epoch 04 is in scope for:

- verification architecture and claim-state decisions
- verification data-model foundations
- verification request lifecycle
- evidence metadata/storage-policy design
- bounded verification submission UI/surfaces
- bounded reviewer queue/review tooling planning or minimal implementation
- verification-related audit/security-event extension
- retention/deletion/privacy rules
- validation and handoff review for the verification foundation

## 5. What Epoch 04 Is Not

Epoch 04 must not implement:

- community boards/posts/rooms
- full moderation dashboard
- payments
- mobile app scaffold
- AI final approval
- employer-system lookup
- scraping private airline systems or private groups
- employee database lookup
- storing unredacted badge data longer than needed
- broad admin platform work beyond bounded verification review needs

## 6. Core Verification Rules

Every Epoch 04 ticket must preserve these rules:

- work-email verification is separate from login email when needed
- raw proof is sensitive, private, and short-lived
- reviewer actions must be auditable
- reviewers cannot approve themselves
- verification results produce claims, not social trust theater
- no route or UI should imply beta approval or worker verification are the same thing
- no route or UI should imply employer endorsement

## 7. Mobile-Readiness Rule

Epoch 04 tickets must classify work as:

- `web-only`
- `mobile-ready`
- `shared-core`

Verification data, status, evidence metadata, claims, retention policy, and authorization rules should be `mobile-ready` or `shared-core` unless a task is strictly web-delivery UI.

## 10. Important Ops/Brand Follow-Up

This epoch should preserve, but not silently absorb, the following later operational follow-up:

- customize Supabase auth email templates for jmpseat branding
- configure custom SMTP/domain sender so confirmation and reset emails do not look third-party

These are important trust/brand tasks, but they are not automatically part of worker-verification implementation unless a later scoped ticket explicitly pulls them in as an ops/brand follow-up.

5. `E04-T05`
6. `E04-T06`
7. `E04-T07`
8. `E04-T08`
9. `E04-T09`
10. `E04-T10`
