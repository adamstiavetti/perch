# Epoch 05: Operator/Admin Tooling Foundation Ticket Pack

Brand note: jmpseat is the canonical product and app name. This ticket pack does not claim legal or trademark clearance for the name.

Product principle: Utility first. Community second. Social feed last.

Identity principle: Verified privately. Anonymous publicly. Accountable internally.

jmpseat is not affiliated with or endorsed by any airline, airport, union, or employer unless explicitly obtained and documented.

## 1. Epoch Objective

Epoch 05 builds the bounded operator/admin tooling foundation needed to run verification safely without routine manual SQL.

Epoch 04 proved the worker-verification repo/runtime foundation: work-email verification, redacted proof upload, reviewer routing, controlled proof viewing, proof retention/deletion cleanup, protected cleanup triggers, and audit events all exist. The next bottleneck is operational safety. Approved domains, reviewer scopes, cleanup monitoring, and audit inspection still require operator-level care that should not remain ad hoc as real users and real proof uploads increase.

Epoch 05 bridges the verification foundation and future claim-gated community features by making verification operations manageable, authorized, audited, and privacy-preserving.

## 2. Epoch 04 Baseline

Epoch 05 starts from the completed Epoch 04 repo/runtime foundation, including:

- Verification data model.
- Approved email domains.
- Work-email verification foundation.
- Reviewer scopes.
- Human review queue.
- Transactional review RPC.
- Verification security events.
- Claims-based authorization preparation.
- Redacted proof upload to private Storage.
- Requested-airline reviewer routing.
- Controlled reviewer proof viewing.
- Proof retention/deletion cleanup.
- Protected manual cleanup trigger.
- Vercel-Cron-compatible cleanup route.
- Runtime proof docs and operator docs.

This baseline is complete for verification foundation work, but it does not complete public launch readiness, legal/privacy copy, production monitoring, or scalable operator workflows.

## 3. Why This Comes Before Community

Claim-gated community surfaces should not be built on top of manual verification operations.

Before rooms, boards, posts, comments, or feeds are exposed, operators need safe ways to manage:

- Who can use operator/admin tools.
- Which email domains are approved for work-email verification.
- Which reviewers can review which airline, role, base, or global scopes.
- Whether proof cleanup is running and failing safely.
- Which verification requests, claims, review actions, and security events need attention.

Without these tools, community access would depend on fragile manual SQL workflows and would increase the risk of overbroad reviewer access, stale domains, missed cleanup failures, and insufficient audit visibility.

## 4. Non-Goals

Epoch 05 must not include:

- Community boards, rooms, posts, comments, feeds, or anonymous posting.
- Claim-gated community implementation.
- Verification claim issuance rule changes unless explicitly ticketed and reviewed.
- Employer-system lookup.
- Private airline-system scraping.
- AI/OCR approval or AI precheck.
- Public proof URLs.
- Broad Supabase Storage list/read policies.
- Query-string secrets for privileged actions.
- Client-side service-role behavior.
- Signed proof URL storage or logging.
- Arbitrary Storage object deletion.
- UI delete controls for ordinary reviewers.
- Mobile app implementation.
- Custom SMTP/auth email branding implementation.
- Public launch/legal/privacy readiness claims.

## 5. Security And Privacy Boundaries

All Epoch 05 work must preserve these boundaries:

- Operator/admin access must be role/scope-backed, not hard-coded to founder or admin email addresses.
- Operator authorization must be checked server-side and, where applicable, enforced by RLS/RPC boundaries.
- Self-escalation must be prevented for operator access, approved-domain management, and reviewer-scope management.
- Every privileged operator action must be audited.
- Service-role credentials must remain server-only.
- Normal users must not see privileged navigation, privileged data, or privileged actions.
- Reviewer tools must remain separate from broader operator/admin tools unless a ticket explicitly bridges them.
- Raw proof files must remain private.
- Proof storage paths, signed URLs, public URLs, raw filenames, proof contents, OCR text, employee IDs, badge numbers, barcode data, QR data, secrets, tokens, and passwords must not appear in UI or security-event metadata.
- Existing controlled proof-viewing and proof-cleanup helpers should be reused rather than bypassed.

## 6. Required Runtime Validation Posture

Each code-bearing Epoch 05 ticket must include:

- Focused unit/integration tests for the touched authorization, route, RPC, RLS, and UI behavior.
- Negative authorization tests for ordinary users and unauthorized operators.
- Self-escalation tests where scope or access changes are possible.
- Audit-event tests for privileged actions.
- Metadata-sanitization tests for any security event or operator response.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run build` unless explicitly docs-only.
- Runtime validation docs before declaring the ticket complete if the ticket affects privileged production behavior.

Runtime validation must confirm that privileged routes do not expose secrets, proof paths, signed URLs, public URLs, raw filenames, proof contents, or stack traces.

## 7. Ordered Tickets

### E05-T01 Operator Access Model Decision

Status: not started.

Type: docs/design only.

Objective:

- Decide the minimum viable authorization model for operator/admin tools before implementing any operator surface.

Scope:

- Define who can access operator/admin tools.
- Avoid hard-coded founder/admin email checks.
- Prefer role/scope-backed access that can be managed and audited.
- Decide whether the MVP should use a dedicated operator role table, approved claims, reviewer scopes, or a separate admin-scope model.
- Identify likely RLS, RPC, table, and security-event needs without implementing them.
- Define self-escalation prevention requirements.
- Define audit requirements for operator access grants, revocations, and privileged actions.
- Define how operator authorization relates to existing reviewer scopes without accidentally making every reviewer a broad operator.

Out of scope:

- App code.
- Migrations.
- Operator UI.
- Reviewer-scope changes.
- Approved-domain changes.
- Any production behavior change.

Acceptance criteria:

- A decision doc exists and is linked from the roadmap/build tickets.
- The chosen MVP operator authorization model is explicit.
- Founder/admin email hard-coding is rejected or tightly constrained as a temporary non-production fallback only if unavoidable.

## 9. Preserved Production Follow-Ups

Epoch 05 does not complete public launch readiness. The following remain tracked production follow-ups:

## 10. Recommended First Ticket

Start Epoch 05 with E05-T01: Operator Access Model Decision.

Do not implement admin tooling until the access model, self-escalation rules, RLS/RPC posture, and audit requirements are explicitly decided.
