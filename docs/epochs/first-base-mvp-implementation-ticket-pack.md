# First-Base MVP Implementation Ticket Pack

Brand note: jmpseat is the canonical product and app name. This document does not claim legal or trademark clearance for the name.

jmpseat is not affiliated with or endorsed by any airline, airport, union, or employer unless explicitly obtained and documented.

## 1. Executive Summary

This is the implementation ticket pack for the pivoted First-Base MVP. It translates the completed strategy docs into an ordered, reviewable implementation plan for airline-email general access, general baseboards, restricted board access requests, community-admin approval, text-only board content, baseline moderation/reporting, and launch-readiness validation.

This pack supersedes continuing E05-T08 as the next implementation path. E05-T08 remains paused unless explicitly reactivated. The completed Epoch 04 and Epoch 05 proof/admin foundations remain historical/runtime-proven infrastructure, not the forward product roadmap.

Implementation should proceed in small, reviewable slices. Each ticket should stop before commit for review unless the user explicitly asks for commit/merge work after review.

Proof-upload expansion remains frozen. The First-Base MVP must not add new badge upload, proof upload, proof review, proof-based role/base claims, or proof cleanup expansion.

## 2. Source Docs

This pack is based on:

- `docs/strategy/product-pivot-email-verification-community-boards.md`
- `docs/strategy/airline-email-access-gate-decision.md`
- `docs/strategy/board-community-access-model-decision.md`
- `docs/strategy/proof-system-freeze-deprecation-plan.md`
- `docs/strategy/first-base-mvp-scope.md`
- `docs/strategy/community-admin-responsibilities-disclaimer-policy.md`
- `docs/strategy/launch-readiness-gate-transition-plan.md`
- `docs/strategy/beta-invite-code-foundation-decision.md`
- `docs/ops/auth-email-branding-confirmation-template-plan.md`

## 3. Non-Negotiable Boundaries

- No badge upload.
- No proof upload.
- No proof-based role/base claims.
- No employer-system lookup.
- No AI/OCR verification.
- No official airline sponsorship implication.
- No community-admin access to proof systems.
- No deleting existing proof infrastructure without a separate reviewed plan.
- No removing the beta gate except through an explicit launch-readiness task.
- No code or migration task should combine unrelated concerns.

## 4. Recommended Implementation Sequence

Recommended order:

1. `FBMVP-T01` Freeze user-facing proof verification surfaces. Implemented and merged; see `docs/epochs/fbmvp-t01-freeze-user-facing-proof-verification-surfaces.md`.
2. `FBMVP-T02` Airline-email verification access state design/implementation. Helper implementation complete and merged; see `docs/epochs/fbmvp-t02-airline-email-verification-access-state-design.md` and `docs/epochs/fbmvp-t02-airline-email-verification-access-state-implementation.md`.
3. `FBMVP-T03` Private-testing versus first-base-launch gate implementation. Implemented and merged; see `docs/epochs/fbmvp-t03-private-testing-versus-first-base-launch-gate-implementation.md`.
4. `FBMVP-T03A` Beta invite-code foundation. Implemented and runtime-proven on the linked Supabase runtime; see `docs/strategy/beta-invite-code-foundation-decision.md`, `docs/epochs/fbmvp-t03a-beta-invite-code-foundation-implementation.md`, and `docs/ops/beta-invite-code-foundation-runtime-pass.md`.
5. `FBMVP-T04` Onboarding/signup flow update. Implemented and merged; see `docs/epochs/fbmvp-t04-onboarding-signup-flow-update.md`.
6. App-generated work-email confirmation email flow. Historical implementation doc remains at `docs/epochs/work-email-confirmation-email-flow-implementation.md`, but newer roadmap/auth-closeout docs now treat the current work-email/auth flow as implemented and founder-confirmed on beta. Treat this ticket-pack item as historical context, not the immediate next lane.
7. Auth email branding / confirmation template manual ops. Deferred TODO; see `docs/ops/auth-email-branding-confirmation-template-plan.md`. This is trust/deliverability/polish work for already-working auth email flows, not the active next auth-flow implementation task.
8. `FBMVP-T05` Base and board data model design.
9. `FBMVP-T06` Board membership and access request model.
10. `FBMVP-T07` Community-admin role model.

17. `FBMVP-T14` First-base launch readiness validation.

## 5. Per-Ticket Detail

### FBMVP-T01 Freeze User-Facing Proof Verification Surfaces

Status: implemented and validated locally; stop before commit for review. See `docs/epochs/fbmvp-t01-freeze-user-facing-proof-verification-surfaces.md`.

Goal: Hide or disable proof upload from normal user flows and update verification copy so proof upload is no longer presented as a forward app-access path.

Scope:

- Hide or disable proof upload CTAs/forms for normal users.
- Update `/app/verification` copy around the pivot.
- Preserve legacy proof ops/admin safety.
- Add regression tests preventing proof-upload reintroduction in normal user flows.

Out of scope:

- Schema deletion.
- Storage bucket deletion.
- Proof cleanup behavior changes.
- Reviewer/operator proof tooling removal.

Likely files/areas:

- `app/app/verification/page.tsx`
- `src/lib/verification/surface.ts`
- `src/lib/verification/actions.ts` only if needed to block normal proof submission safely
- verification surface tests
- strategy/epoch docs and runtime proof docs

Migration likely needed: no.

Authorization/security boundaries:

- Normal users must not be offered proof upload.
- Legacy operator/reviewer proof safety tools must remain protected and unchanged unless explicitly scoped.
- No raw proof files, storage paths, signed URLs, filenames, or proof contents may be exposed.

Tests expected:

- Verification page no longer presents proof upload as a current path.
- Normal user proof-upload action is unavailable or safely blocked if still reachable.
- Existing proof access, proof retention, and cleanup tests remain passing.
- Approved-domain/work-email tests remain passing.

Runtime validation expected:

- Confirm `/app/verification` shows pivot-safe airline-email copy.
- Confirm no normal proof-upload path is visible.
- Confirm legacy proof cleanup/admin routes remain protected.

Stop-before-commit/review requirements:

- Stop before commit after implementation and validation.
- Do not run `supabase db push` unless a later reviewed migration task explicitly requires it.

### FBMVP-T02 Airline-Email Verification Access State Design/Implementation

Status: helper implementation complete pending review. See `docs/epochs/fbmvp-t02-airline-email-verification-access-state-design.md` and `docs/epochs/fbmvp-t02-airline-email-verification-access-state-implementation.md`.

Goal: Refactor existing work-email verification into the forward `airline_email_verified` app-level access state.

Implemented scope:

- Add a pure helper/adapter that derives safe airline-email access state from existing approved-domain, verification request, evidence, and claim records.
- Preserve approved domain management without schema changes.
- Support verification timestamp, pending, unsupported-domain, revoked, expired, not-verified, and not-ready states.
- Keep login email and airline employee email distinct.

Deferred scope:

- Schema normalization for future expiry/refresh/revocation complexity, if later justified by a reviewed migration task.
- Gate integration and launch-mode behavior.

Out of scope:

- Role/base claim issuance.
- Board membership.
- Launch gate switch.
- Proof upload.

Implemented files/areas:

- `src/lib/verification/airlineEmailAccess.ts`
- `test/verification/airlineEmailAccess.test.mts`
- `docs/epochs/fbmvp-t02-airline-email-verification-access-state-implementation.md`

Migration likely needed: no for the helper/adapter implementation. Future schema work may still be reviewed separately if the adapter becomes insufficient.

Authorization/security boundaries:

- Airline-email verification proves broad eligibility only.
- Unsupported domains must not grant access.
- Personal login email alone must not prove eligibility.
- Verification state must not grant restricted-board access.

Tests expected:

- Supported approved-domain email can become `airline_email_verified`.
- Unsupported, expired, revoked, or pending states do not grant access.
- Login email and airline employee email can be distinct.
- No role/base/global restricted-board claims are issued.

Runtime validation expected:

- Apply migration only after review/merge in a separate runtime task.
- Runtime-prove approved and unsupported domain paths without printing privileged identifiers or secrets.

Stop-before-commit/review requirements:

- Stop before commit after implementation and local validation.
- Keep migration unapplied until explicit migration-apply task.

### FBMVP-T03 Private-Testing Versus First-Base-Launch Gate Implementation

Goal: Add explicit launch mode behavior for private testing, first-base launch, broader launch, and internal test flags.

Scope:

- Add explicit launch mode config: `private_testing`, `first_base_launch`, `broader_launch`, `internal_test`.
- During `private_testing`, require beta access plus airline-email verification.
- During `first_base_launch`, require airline-email verification for the launched population without one-by-one beta grants.
- Add access-hold/access-restricted copy for each relevant denial state.

Out of scope:

- Board implementation.
- Airline-email state creation if not already complete.
- Broad public launch.

Likely files/areas:

- `src/lib/privateApp/access.ts`
- `src/lib/betaAccess/*`
- `app/app/access-hold/page.tsx`
- `app/auth/callback/route.ts`
- private-app/access tests
- auth route tests

Migration likely needed: unlikely unless mode is stored in database.

Authorization/security boundaries:

- Do not remove beta casually.
- Do not let beta imply airline-email eligibility.
- Do not let airline-email verification grant restricted board access.
- Launch mode must be explicit and test-covered.

Tests expected:

- `private_testing` requires beta plus airline-email verification.
- `first_base_launch` does not require manual beta grants for launched population.
- Unsupported/unverified airline email blocks app/baseboard access.
- Reviewer/operator/community-admin authority is not inferred from app access.

Runtime validation expected:

- Runtime-prove each launch mode gate with safe test users or safe fixtures.
- Record runtime proof docs for gate behavior.

Stop-before-commit/review requirements:

- Stop before commit after implementation and validation.
- Do not change production launch mode or deploy in the implementation task.

### FBMVP-T03A Beta Invite-Code Foundation

Status: implemented and runtime-proven on the linked Supabase runtime; runtime-proof review pending. See `docs/strategy/beta-invite-code-foundation-decision.md`, `docs/epochs/fbmvp-t03a-beta-invite-code-foundation-implementation.md`, and `docs/ops/beta-invite-code-foundation-runtime-pass.md`.

Goal: Implement the private-testing beta invite-code foundation before onboarding/signup work depends on invite-code copy, access-hold behavior, or beta-access grant semantics.

Implemented scope:

- Batch-generated invite codes for private testing capacity control.
- Single-use by default.
- Random and non-personal by default.
- Hash-only storage after generation.
- Operator-only server batch generation helper requiring `operator.manage_beta_invites`.
- Batch pause/close/revoke states and code revoked/expired/redeemed states.
- Safe audit event taxonomy for batch creation, redemption, failed redemption, and beta grants from invite redemption.
- Redemption grants beta access only after server-side validation.
- Invite codes never prove airline eligibility.
- Access-hold redemption form appears only when beta access is required and airline-email eligibility is verified.

Out of scope:

- Full operator/admin invite-code UI.
- FBMVP-T04 onboarding/signup changes.
- Baseboards, board memberships, posting, or restricted-board gates.
- App-gate changes beyond beta access becoming grantable through invite redemption.
- Launch-mode behavior changes for `first_base_launch` or `broader_launch`.
- Community-admin invite management.
- Restricted-board access.
- Proof upload or badge upload.

Implemented files/areas:

- `supabase/migrations/20260606120000_add_beta_invite_code_foundation.sql`
- `src/lib/betaAccess/*`
- `app/app/access-hold/page.tsx`
- beta access and private-app access tests

Migration created and applied to the linked Supabase runtime. Runtime validation is recorded in `docs/ops/beta-invite-code-foundation-runtime-pass.md`.

Authorization/security boundaries:

- Invite code alone must not grant app access.
- Invite code must not grant airline-email verification.
- Invite code must not grant restricted board access, reviewer access, operator access, or community-admin authority.
- Plaintext invite codes must not be logged or stored after generation.
- Redemption errors must not reveal whether a code exists, expired, was revoked, or was already redeemed in an enumeration-helpful way.

Tests expected:

- Batch generation is operator-only and bounded.
- Codes are single-use by default.
- Redemption grants beta access only through server-side validation.
- `private_testing` still requires airline-email verification plus beta access.
- `first_base_launch` and `broader_launch` do not require invite codes for general launched access.
- Invalid redemption failures are safe and generic.
- Plaintext codes, secrets, tokens, and private identifiers are not logged or returned after generation.

Runtime validation expected:

- Runtime-prove operator batch generation, redemption, duplicate redemption denial, revoked/expired denial, and launch-mode boundaries without printing secrets, privileged identifiers, plaintext codes, or private user data.

Stop-before-commit/review requirements:

- Stop before commit after implementation and validation.
- Do not run `supabase db push` until an explicit migration-apply task.

### FBMVP-T04 Onboarding/Signup Flow Update

Status: implemented and merged. See `docs/epochs/fbmvp-t04-onboarding-signup-flow-update.md`.

Implemented scope:

- Updated signup/login copy so account credentials, airline-email eligibility, and closed beta invite-code requirements are legible.
- Updated access-hold copy while preserving existing launch-mode and invite-code gate behavior.
- Updated verification page copy to reflect the implemented gate model.
- Updated profile copy to keep self-declared profile fields separate from airline employee email verification.
- Kept profile requirements minimal and did not add a migration.

Out of scope:

- Proof upload.
- Restricted board requests.
- Community-admin tooling.

Likely files/areas:

- `app/signup/page.tsx`
- `app/app/profile/page.tsx`

- Do not expose full airline employee email in public/profile surfaces.
- Avoid over-collecting profile data.

Tests expected:

- Distinct login email and airline employee email are supported.
- Minimal required profile fields are enforced.
- Unsupported airline email routes users to safe hold/copy.
- No proof-upload onboarding requirement exists.

### FBMVP-T04A Account Signup Code Confirmation

Status: implemented pending review. See
`docs/epochs/account-signup-code-confirmation-implementation.md`.

while preserving Supabase Auth as the source of truth.

Implemented scope:

- Signup success guides users to an account-code confirmation state.
- Users enter account email plus a six-digit Supabase account confirmation code.
- Account-code confirmation uses Supabase Auth verification.

  supported for compatibility and password reset.

Out of scope:

- Work-email / airline-email verification changes.
- Beta invite-code changes.
- Founder/admin/operator access changes.
- Launch-mode changes.
- Proof upload, badge upload, document upload, proof review, role/base claims,
  or baseboard/community work.

Migration created: no.

Runtime validation expected:

- Update the Supabase Confirm Signup template to the code-first `{{ .Token }}`
  shape after review/deploy.
- Runtime-prove fresh account signup code confirmation on the beta/stable test
  surface without printing auth links, account codes, tokens, private emails, or
  secrets.

Runtime validation expected:

- Verify signup/onboarding paths for supported and unsupported domains.
- Confirm user-facing copy does not imply official airline sponsorship.

Stop-before-commit/review requirements:

- Stop before commit after implementation and validation.
- Do not deploy or change live rollout copy without review.

Follow-up before founder/Yuri Vercel testing or public-ish waitlist login entry:

- Supabase confirmation email template / custom SMTP / auth email branding polish, following `docs/ops/auth-email-branding-confirmation-template-plan.md`.
- Keep the Closed Beta Login landing entry deferred until this auth email experience is configured and validated.

Recommended first code ticket: `FBMVP-T01 Freeze User-Facing Proof Verification Surfaces`.

Rationale:

- It prevents accidental proof-upload expansion before new flows are built.
- It reduces user-facing privacy risk.
- It aligns current visible verification copy with the pivot.
- It preserves legacy proof ops/admin safety while making the forward product direction clear.

Next ticket after `FBMVP-T03`: `FBMVP-T03A Beta Invite-Code Foundation`, because private testing still needs a clear batch/single-use invite-code model before onboarding and access-hold copy depend on invite redemption behavior.

Auth-flow status after `FBMVP-T04`: app-generated work-email confirmation is implemented in `docs/epochs/work-email-confirmation-email-flow-implementation.md`, account signup confirmation is code-first through Supabase Auth-native six-digit codes, and password reset remains link-driven. Continue to use `docs/ops/auth-email-branding-confirmation-template-plan.md` only as the deferred TODO for Supabase Auth confirmation/reset branding, custom SMTP or sender-domain decisions, redirect URLs, and safe test-email behavior.

The public landing Closed Beta Login entry remains deferred by the broader launch/readiness lane, not solely by custom SMTP or auth email template polish.

## 8. Validation Standards

Every implementation ticket should run focused tests first, then broader checks appropriate to its blast radius.

Expected standards:

- Run focused node tests for touched auth/profile/beta/verification/community/moderation/admin modules.
- Run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run build` for code changes unless explicitly scoped otherwise.
- Run `git diff --check`.
- Do not run `supabase db push` before review.
- Treat migration apply as separate from merge.
- Create runtime proof docs for sensitive gate/access changes.
- Do not print or commit secrets, env values, privileged identifiers, raw proof contents, signed URLs, public proof URLs, storage paths, service-role data, or private user data.

## 9. Documentation Update Requirements

Each implementation ticket should update:

- `docs/BUILD_TICKETS.md`
- `docs/EPOCH_ROADMAP.md`
- relevant strategy/epoch docs
- runtime proof docs when applicable

Documentation should preserve historical Epoch 04 and Epoch 05 proof/operator work as completed/runtime history while making clear it is not the forward product roadmap.

## 10. Open Questions Blocking Implementation

These questions should be answered before implementation begins:

- Is DFW formally selected as first base?
- Is first-base launch airport-wide or airline-specific?
- Which airline domains are included for first launch?
- Which restricted boards are MVP?
- What minimal profile fields are required?
- Should users self-select base before general board access?
- What exact moderation tooling is required before first live launch?
- Who appoints first community admins?

## 11. Source-Of-Truth Statement

This ticket pack is the forward implementation plan for the pivoted First-Base MVP.

It replaces continuing proof-upload verification/admin expansion as the next implementation path. E05-T08 remains paused unless explicitly reactivated.

Future Codex tasks should follow this ticket pack unless the user updates the strategy docs.
