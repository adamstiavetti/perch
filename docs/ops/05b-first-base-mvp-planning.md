## 1. Purpose

This is the controlling planning note for the current `05B / First-Base MVP`
implementation lane.

Use this doc when deciding what the first code tickets should build right now.
Do not treat older broad V1 or full-beta docs as the immediate implementation
lane unless this doc or a newer controlling roadmap doc explicitly says so.

## 2. Current 05B Interpretation

`05B / First-Base MVP` is the first launch package for the personalized
aviation-worker utility/community network. It is not broad V1, and DFW is not
the whole product concept.

Current DFW framing:

- first launch base: DFW
- first available base board: DFW Base Board
- DFW is the only live base in the initial rollout
- the data model should support many bases and boards from the start

The current MVP direction includes:

- Base Boards
- Layover Boards
- Verified Lounges / role-based spaces under or associated with bases
- user profiles
- following users
- following boards
- posting
- commenting/replies
- sharing
- saving posts
- liking/upvoting/useful-marking posts, with final brand terminology still
  undecided
- useful/trending posts inside base boards
- search across posts, comments, boards, base intel, and admin/AI-maintained
  information

The first implementation steps should build toward that model without trying to
ship every surface in the first code ticket.

Use `docs/strategy/base-board-product-definition.md` as the canonical product
definition for what a Base Board is. In short, a Base Board is the main
verified hub/container for an aviation base. It combines structured base intel,
searchable community posts, useful/trending knowledge, related Layover Boards,
and restricted Verified Lounges; it is not one thread, not a generic social
feed, and not only a static wiki.

Use `docs/strategy/home-base-board-follow-decision.md` as the canonical
decision note for Home Base and Board Follow behavior before implementing
`FBMVP-T06`.

## 3. Personalized App Experience

The MVP user experience is personalized:

- users may set a Home Base for personalization, but Home Base is not required
  app access state and not authorization truth
- the initial rollout should not show a fake one-option Home Base picker
- after work-email verification in the DFW-only rollout, users should choose
  Start with DFW or Skip for now
- Start with DFW should set Home Base to DFW and automatically follow the DFW
  Base Board
- Skip for now should create no Home Base preference, require no automatic
  board follow, and still allow app entry when the real gates pass
- users without Home Base should later see an exploratory/default experience
- users can follow other base boards
- users can follow layover boards
- users can follow Verified Lounges only when access/membership permits
- the app home should eventually reflect followed boards, home base,
  saved/useful content, followed users, Verified Lounge memberships, and
  relevant updates

Following a board does not grant restricted access. Self-declared profile
fields such as `claimed_base`, `claimed_airline`, and `claimed_role` must not
become authorization truth.

Canonical onboarding order for the initial DFW-only rollout:

1. Create account
2. Confirm account
3. Complete basic profile
4. Verify work email
5. Choose Start with DFW or Skip for now
6. If starting with DFW, set Home Base to DFW and auto-follow DFW Base Board
7. If skipping, keep no Home Base preference and no required auto-follow
8. Enter the jmpseat Home dashboard or exploratory/default app experience

Canonical onboarding order for a future multi-base rollout:

1. Create account
2. Confirm account
3. Complete basic profile
4. Verify work email
5. Select Home Base from active bases, or skip if Home Base remains optional
6. Enter the jmpseat Home dashboard or exploratory/default app experience

## 4. Utility Layer / Board Intel

Base boards should support structured base intel/wiki sections.

Board intel/wiki is structured content attached to a board. It is not a board
type.

Examples:

- basic airport/base information
- commuting
- parking
- reserve life
- food
- transit
- safety/weather/service alerts where appropriate

This content may be maintained by founders/admins and assisted by AI later.
AI-assisted updates must be server-side/admin-controlled and should not
auto-publish sensitive or operationally risky content without review.

## 5. Verified Lounges

Each base may have role-based or restricted lounges, such as Flight Attendants,
Pilots, New Hire Survival, Commuters, or similar spaces.

Verified Lounges are not generic global chat rooms. They are base-associated,
role-based, or otherwise restricted spaces with scoped access rules.

Board/community admins can be appointed to approve or deny access to these
spaces. Community-admin powers are scoped and separate from operator/platform
admin powers.

## 6. Posting, Engagement, And Search

Text-first posting and commenting are part of the MVP.

Engagement should be modeled generically until the product chooses canonical
jmpseat terminology for reactions, likes, upvotes, or "useful" marks.

TODO: define canonical jmpseat reaction terminology before final user-facing
copy and analytics naming are locked.

Search is part of the MVP vision. It should cover useful content across the app,
including posts/comments, boards, base info/wiki, and layover intel. Search
should support quick information retrieval by base/board and must respect
access controls and restricted-board visibility.

## 7. Current First Slice

The first slice is a launchable path toward the fuller MVP:

- DFW as the first launch base
- DFW Base Board as the first available base board
- data model support for many bases and boards
- airline-email gated app eligibility
- board follows/home-base preference foundation
- restricted lounge memberships and access requests
- board-scoped community-admin approval
- text-first posts/comments later in the sequence
- saves/reactions/useful/trending later in the sequence
- access-aware search later in the sequence
- reporting/moderation before real member-generated content exposure

This lane does not start with a generic social feed, broad room expansion, or
marketplace surface.

## 8. First Code Ticket

The first implemented code ticket in this lane is:

- `FBMVP-T05: Base, Board, And Board-Type Data Model Design`

Current implementation note:

- T05 creates the initial database/model foundation only.
- T05 is merged in repo history and the targeted Supabase runtime apply pass is
  recorded in `docs/ops/fbmvp-t05-base-board-runtime-pass.md`.
- T05 seeds DFW as the first launch base and DFW Base Board as the first
  available board.
- T05 seeds the controlled board types `base_board`, `layover_board`, and
  `verified_lounge`.
- T05 does not add board follows, home-base preferences, lounge memberships,
  access requests, posts, comments, saves, reactions, search, reports, or
  moderation.
- T06 should follow the Home Base / Board Follow decision note, including the
  rule that Home Base auto-follows the matching Base Board while neither Home
  Base nor board follows grant restricted access.
- T06 should support the optional initial DFW-start behavior first and leave
  real multi-base selection/switching support ready for later active-base
  rollout.

Current T06 implementation note:

- T06 is implemented and merged as the Home Base preference and board follow
  data foundation.
- The intended Supabase runtime already has the base T06 schema/functions
  recorded as remote migration
  `20260609194858 create_home_base_board_follows`.
- The local repo file remains
  `20260609130534_create_home_base_board_follows.sql`; do not re-apply it and
  do not mark `20260609130534` applied retroactively.
- Follow-up migration
  `20260609200310_harden_home_base_rpc_execute_grants.sql` removes explicit
  `anon` EXECUTE from the three T06 RPCs while preserving authenticated and
  service-role execution. That hardening is runtime-applied and recorded in
  `docs/ops/fbmvp-t06-home-base-board-follows-runtime-pass.md`.
- It adds optional Home Base preference state, board follows, an authenticated
  `set_user_home_base(p_base_code text)` RPC, and server-only helpers.
- The RPC sets the authenticated user's active Home Base and auto-follows the
  matching active Base Board.
- If the user skips the initial DFW-start choice, no Home Base preference or
  automatic board follow is required.
- Missing Home Base must not block app access after work-email and other real
  app-entry gates pass.
- It keeps old board follows when Home Base changes.
- It does not implement onboarding UI, dashboard UI, manual follow/unfollow UI,
  restricted lounge membership/access approval, posts, comments, saves,
  reactions, search, reports, or moderation.
- Future runtime schema changes must still use targeted apply because known
  Supabase migration-history drift remains.

Rationale:

- no current board/community schema exists
- no current community routes or UI exist
- the repo already has auth, profile, beta-access, airline-email eligibility,
  and operator/admin foundations to build on
- the data model must support bases, boards, board types, follows,
  subscriptions, memberships, access requests, community-admin grants, and
  future posts/comments/saves/reactions/search without creating a dead-end
  schema
- T05 does not implement every MVP feature; it makes the foundation model-aware

## 9. Ordered Ticket Sequence

The current implementation sequence is:

1. `FBMVP-T05` base, board, and board-type data model, merged and runtime-applied
2. `FBMVP-T06` Home Base preference and board-follow foundation, merged and runtime-hardened
3. `FBMVP-T07` restricted lounge membership/access request/community-admin model
4. `FBMVP-T08` DFW Base Board read-only dashboard shell
5. `FBMVP-T09` board/layover discovery and follow UI shell
6. `FBMVP-T10` text posts/comments foundation
7. `FBMVP-T11` saves/reactions/useful/trending foundation
8. `FBMVP-T12` search foundation with access-aware boundaries
9. `FBMVP-T13` reporting/moderation/admin controls
10. `FBMVP-T14` seeded DFW content, safety copy, and launch validation

## 10. Authorization Rules To Preserve

- Self-declared profile fields must not become authorization truth.
- Airline-email verification grants broad app eligibility only.
- Airline-email verification does not grant restricted-board membership.
- Restricted-board access must come from board membership plus
  community-admin approval.
- Community-admin grants must remain separate from operator grants.
- Moderation/reporting/admin controls are required before exposing real
  member-generated content.

## 11. Safety And Moderation Boundaries

Reporting/moderation/admin controls are required before broad real UGC exposure.
Aviation safety and privacy boundaries still apply:

- no exact public crew hotel exposure
- no passenger private information
- no airport security procedures
- no live operations-sensitive information
- no airline portal login or scraping

## 12. Explicitly Out Of Scope For The First Slice

- proof uploads
- manual proof/document uploads
- generic social feed
- generic global Crew Rooms expansion
- media/upload posting unless explicitly approved
- anonymous posting unless separately approved
- AI auto-publishing or AI final verification/moderation decisions
- deals/perks marketplace
- full mobile implementation
- schedule scraping
- airline portal login
- public live crew tracking
- exact public crew hotel exposure

Proof-upload hardening remains historically documented, but it is not active
current scope for this lane.

## 13. How To Read Older Docs

Read the following as broader/full-beta or later-lane references unless they
are explicitly narrowed by this doc or a newer controlling roadmap note:

- `docs/BETA_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md`
- `docs/PRIVATE_BETA_OPERATING_PLAN.md`
- `docs/MVP_SCOPE.md`
- `docs/FIRST_RELEASE_MVP.md`

Those docs remain useful for later scope, policy gates, and broader product
direction. They should not pull the first 05B implementation slice wider than
the sequence above.
