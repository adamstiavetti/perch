# Epoch 5 Level-Set

Date: 2026-06-07

Current baseline commit: `835972c fix: redact operator grant audit identifiers`

## Final Closeout Update

Epoch 5 is closed with explicit carry-forward items as of
`docs/ops/epoch-5-final-closeout.md`.

This level-set remains useful as the capability matrix. The final closeout doc
is now the controlling handoff for what is closed, what is conditionally closed,
and what carries forward. The immediate post-Epoch-5 planning bridge is now
captured in `docs/ops/private-beta-readiness-bridge.md`.

## Summary

Epoch 5 is the bounded operator/admin tooling foundation for running verification
operations without routine manual SQL. The original E05-T01 through E05-T07
operator/admin slices are implemented and runtime-proven, and the newer
post-bootstrap operator grant management path is now runtime-proven through the
linked runtime RPC/action path used by `/app/admin/operator-access`. The
auth/onboarding detour is closed, `/app/access-hold` is the active airline
employee email verification and beta status surface, and founder/admin internal
access uses explicit operator grants instead of temporary work-email domain
approval.

## Capability Matrix

| Capability | Status | Evidence files | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Epoch 5 scope and sequencing | runtime-proven | `docs/EPOCH_ROADMAP.md`, `docs/BUILD_TICKETS.md`, `docs/epochs/epoch-05-operator-admin-tooling-tickets.md`, `docs/ops/e05-operator-grant-management-runtime-pass.md` | Current roadmap says E05 is a paused/runtime-proven foundation. E05-T01 through E05-T07 and the post-bootstrap operator grant management path are implemented and runtime-proven. |
| Operator access model | done | `docs/epochs/e05-operator-access-model-decision.md` | Explicit database-backed operator grants are the model. Operator/admin access is separate from login email, work email, profile text, beta access, verification claims, and reviewer scopes. |
| Admin shell and navigation | runtime-proven | `docs/epochs/e05-admin-shell-navigation-foundation.md`, `docs/ops/operator-grants-bootstrap-runtime-pass.md`, `app/app/admin/page.tsx`, `src/components/admin/AdminShell.tsx`, `src/lib/admin/access.ts`, `test/admin/adminShell.test.mts` | `/app/admin` exists, protected admin navigation exists, normal users do not get privileged tools, and reviewer queue behavior remains separate. |
| Operator grants foundation and first bootstrap | runtime-proven | `docs/epochs/e05-operator-grants-foundation.md`, `docs/ops/operator-grants-bootstrap-runtime-pass.md`, `app/api/ops/operator-bootstrap/route.ts`, `src/lib/admin/operatorBootstrapRoute.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260605113000_create_operator_grants_foundation.sql`, `test/admin/operatorBootstrapRoute.test.mts` | First-operator bootstrap was validated in the linked runtime and closes after an active grant exists. |
| Founder/admin internal private-app access | runtime-proven | `docs/epochs/founder-admin-private-app-access-implementation.md`, `docs/ops/founder-admin-private-app-access-runtime-pass.md`, `docs/ops/operator-private-app-scope-gate-fix.md`, `docs/ops/auth-detour-closeout-runtime-pass.md`, `src/lib/privateApp/access.ts`, `src/lib/betaAccess/server.ts`, `test/private-app/access.test.mts` | Internal access resolves through `operator_internal`, now runtime-provenly requires the dedicated `operator.internal_private_app_access` scope for app-entry override, and does not grant beta access, airline-email eligibility, role claims, base claims, or restricted-board claims. |
| Post-bootstrap operator grant management | runtime-proven | `docs/epochs/operator-grant-management-implementation.md`, `docs/ops/operator-grant-audit-metadata-redaction.md`, `docs/ops/e05-operator-grant-management-runtime-pass.md`, `app/app/admin/operator-access/page.tsx`, `src/lib/admin/operatorGrants.ts`, `src/lib/admin/operatorGrantLookup.ts`, `test/admin/operatorAccess.test.mts`, `supabase/migrations/20260606203000_add_operator_internal_private_app_access_scope.sql`, `supabase/migrations/20260607103000_redact_operator_grant_audit_metadata.sql` | The redaction migration SQL is active in the linked runtime. Existing-operator grant, duplicate active grant, non-operator denial, minimal internal scope behavior, and redacted audit metadata are runtime-proven through the RPC/action path used by `/app/admin/operator-access`. Browser-authenticated form submission remains an optional smoke check because this pass did not use private credentials. |
| Approved-domain management | runtime-proven | `docs/epochs/e05-approved-domain-management.md`, `docs/ops/approved-domain-management-runtime-pass.md`, `app/app/admin/approved-domains/page.tsx`, `src/lib/admin/approvedDomains.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260605184500_add_operator_managed_approved_email_domains.sql`, `supabase/migrations/20260605190500_fix_approved_domain_test_tld_validation.sql`, `test/admin/approvedDomains.test.mts` | Operator-only list/create/update/disable exists and is runtime-proven. Disabled domains stay hidden from normal work-email reads. |
| Reviewer-scope management | runtime-proven | `docs/epochs/e05-reviewer-scope-management.md`, `docs/ops/reviewer-scope-management-runtime-pass.md`, `app/app/admin/reviewer-scopes/page.tsx`, `src/lib/admin/reviewerScopes.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260605213000_add_operator_managed_reviewer_scopes.sql`, `test/admin/reviewerScopes.test.mts` | Operator-controlled reviewer scope grant/revoke exists, with self-escalation protections and linked-runtime proof. |
| Verification review/admin queue | runtime-proven | `app/app/admin/verification/page.tsx`, `src/lib/verification/review.ts`, `src/lib/verification/reviewActions.ts`, `docs/epochs/epoch-04-human-review-queue-foundation-implementation.md`, `docs/ops/verification-runtime-pass-american-airlines.md`, `test/verification/review.test.mts` | Existing reviewer-scope based queue remains separate from operator/admin access. No proof review expansion is part of the current forward path. |
| Verification audit and event inspection | runtime-proven | `docs/epochs/e05-verification-audit-inspection.md`, `docs/ops/verification-audit-inspection-runtime-pass.md`, `app/app/admin/audit/page.tsx`, `src/lib/admin/verificationAudit.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260605223000_add_operator_verification_audit_inspection.sql`, `test/admin/verificationAudit.test.mts` | Metadata-only inspection exists. It excludes raw proof, persistent proof locations, and sensitive runtime values. |
| Security events trust boundary | runtime-proven | `docs/ops/security-events-trust-boundary-fix.md`, `src/lib/securityEvents/server.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260608201541_harden_security_events_trust_boundary.sql`, `test/security-events/securityEventsTrustBoundary.test.mts` | Direct authenticated/anon inserts into trusted `security_events` are removed, legacy rows are marked unverified, future server rows default to trusted, operator/admin audit readers filter to trusted server-produced rows, and the deployed server recorder path is runtime-proven through service-role insertion. |
| Proof upload content validation | historical / deprecated for current path | `docs/ops/proof-upload-content-validation-fix.md`, `src/lib/verification/proofUpload.ts`, `src/lib/verification/actions.ts`, `test/verification/proofUpload.test.mts` | Redacted proof upload now requires server-side JPEG/PNG byte validation instead of trusting browser MIME/extension alone. Private proof bucket behavior and reviewer signed-URL controls remain unchanged. Proof uploads are now out of current product scope, so the old live authenticated mutation test is not an active next task or blocker. |
| Security headers hardening | runtime-proven | `docs/ops/security-headers-hardening.md`, `next.config.ts`, `test/security-headers/securityHeaders.test.mts` | Adds app-owned `nosniff`, strict-origin referrer policy, restrictive permissions policy, enforced anti-framing, and report-only broad CSP. Vercel-provided HSTS is left unchanged. Runtime validation passed on apex, `www`, and beta at `8558d2d`; no CSP report endpoint is configured yet. |
| Beta Vercel env scoping | runtime-verified | `docs/ops/beta-vercel-env-scoping.md` | `beta.jmpseat.com` is a Preview deployment while apex/`www` use Production. The required Supabase env names now exist persistently in Preview, and a normal beta Preview deploy without deployment-scoped Supabase env injection returned healthy beta auth redirects with apex/`www` preserved. |
| Epoch 5 final closeout | closed with carry-forward items | `docs/ops/epoch-5-final-closeout.md` | Closes the bounded operator/admin/security hardening lane while carrying forward deprecated proof-upload scope, CSP reporting/enforcement planning, Vercel deployment-model maturity, Supabase migration drift handling, auth email branding/custom SMTP, and community-access/moderation bridge. |
| Private beta readiness bridge | planned / docs-ready | `docs/ops/private-beta-readiness-bridge.md`, `docs/ops/epoch-5-final-closeout.md`, `docs/ops/auth-email-branding-confirmation-template-plan.md` | Reconciles the current post-Epoch-5 runtime baseline with the broader private-beta docs, keeps proof uploads out of the active lane while preserving historical privacy/security requirements, and defines the narrow lane before 05B / community-access implementation. |
| Proof cleanup monitoring | runtime-proven | `docs/epochs/e05-proof-cleanup-monitoring.md`, `docs/ops/proof-cleanup-monitoring-runtime-pass.md`, `app/app/admin/proof-cleanup/page.tsx`, `src/lib/admin/proofCleanupMonitoring.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260605233000_add_operator_proof_cleanup_monitoring.sql`, `test/admin/proofCleanupMonitoring.test.mts` | Read-only cleanup health, failures, and bounded cleanup audit visibility are runtime-proven. |
| Protected manual proof cleanup controls | runtime-proven | `docs/epochs/e05-protected-manual-proof-cleanup-controls.md`, `docs/ops/protected-manual-proof-cleanup-controls-runtime-pass.md`, `src/lib/admin/proofCleanupControls.ts`, `src/lib/admin/proofCleanupControlsCore.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260605234500_add_operator_manual_proof_cleanup_controls.sql`, `test/admin/proofCleanupControls.test.mts` | Manual cleanup runs only through the existing helper with bounded controls and summary-only audit. Runtime proof did not force a destructive delete because there were zero eligible expired proof rows. |
| Proof upload/review forward product state | deferred | `docs/strategy/proof-system-freeze-deprecation-plan.md`, `docs/epochs/fbmvp-t01-freeze-user-facing-proof-verification-surfaces.md`, `docs/EPOCH_ROADMAP.md`, `docs/BUILD_TICKETS.md` | Proof upload/review infrastructure remains historical and safety-preserved. Forward user-facing proof expansion is frozen unless explicitly reopened. |
| Beta invite-code operator tooling | runtime-proven | `docs/epochs/fbmvp-t03a-beta-invite-code-foundation-implementation.md`, `docs/ops/beta-invite-code-foundation-runtime-pass.md`, `src/lib/betaAccess/inviteCodes.ts`, `test/beta-access/betaInviteCodes.test.mts` | Adjacent private-testing capacity tooling exists and is runtime-proven. It is not a replacement for airline-email eligibility and is not a first-base launch requirement. |
| Auth detour closeout | runtime-proven | `docs/ops/auth-detour-closeout-runtime-pass.md`, `docs/ops/stable-beta-auth-runtime-pass.md`, `docs/ops/auth-design-system-style-guide.md`, `docs/ops/auth-design-overhaul-docs-audit.md` | Founder-confirmed stable beta auth flow is documented. Temporary `jmpseat.com` approved-domain state was soft-disabled and historical rows were preserved. |
| E05-T08 runtime validation and handoff | deferred | `docs/epochs/epoch-05-operator-admin-tooling-tickets.md`, `docs/EPOCH_ROADMAP.md`, `docs/BUILD_TICKETS.md` | Paused by the product pivot. Current docs should not treat E05-T08 as the next code-bearing feature. |
| Community-admin tools, boards, posting, restricted-board gates | missing | `docs/strategy/board-community-access-model-decision.md`, `docs/strategy/community-admin-responsibilities-disclaimer-policy.md`, `docs/epochs/first-base-mvp-implementation-ticket-pack.md` | Not part of Epoch 5. These belong to later community/baseboard implementation lanes. |

## Do Not Reopen Auth Detour

The auth/onboarding detour is closed at the current baseline. Do not reopen it
as an Epoch 5 task unless a real regression is found.

Closed auth facts:

- Stable beta auth runtime pass is recorded.
- Account signup confirmation is code-first.
- Work-email verification is code-first and inline on `/app/access-hold`.
- `/app/verification` is deprecated and redirects to `/app/access-hold`.
- Founder/admin access uses explicit operator grants.
- `jmpseat.com` temporary approved-domain state is documented as soft-disabled.
- Founder/admin access is separate from airline-email eligibility.

Relevant auth-detour artifacts that remain useful to Epoch 5:

- `operator_internal` access-source audit metadata for internal private-app entry.
- The `operator.internal_private_app_access` scope.
- The closeout record confirming temporary domain cleanup.
- The auth design-system docs for future admin/login consistency checks.

## Carry-Forward Items

The final closeout doc is now the source of truth for carry-forward items.
Current carry-forward items are:

1. Proof upload live mutation testing is deprecated/out of current scope for
   the active private beta / 05B path. Code-level validation, deployment, beta
   route smoke, public preservation smoke, and reviewer-access regression tests
   remain historically documented. Existing proof artifacts, if present, remain
   subject to privacy/security controls.
2. Future CSP reporting/enforcement remains pending; the broad CSP is
   report-only and has no report endpoint.
3. Future Vercel deployment-model maturity remains pending: decide whether to
   keep CLI/manual deploys, connect the project to Git, or split public and
   beta into separate projects.
4. Existing remote Supabase migration-history drift remains documented and
   should continue to use targeted migration apply until explicitly resolved.
5. Proof cleanup runtime validation did not perform a live destructive delete,
   because there were no eligible expired proof rows. This is acceptable and
   documented, but it remains a precision caveat.
6. The post-bootstrap operator grant management runtime proof used the
   server-side RPC/action path with authenticated runtime context simulation; a
   live browser-authenticated form submission remains optional if a safe operator
   session is available.
7. E05-T08 is paused by product pivot and should not be treated as a feature
   ticket until the pivot direction explicitly calls for it.

## Recommended Next Ticket

Recommended next single ticket:

`Private Beta Readiness Checklist Reconciliation`

Goal:

Finish the next narrow private-beta-readiness task after the bridge without
reopening proof-upload, broad operator/admin tooling, community boards, or auth
email implementation work.

Scope:

- Keep auth email branding/custom SMTP documented as a deferred
  trust/deliverability/polish TODO.
- Keep proof uploads deprecated/out of current scope unless a future scope
  decision and privacy/security review explicitly reactivate manual-proof or
  document-upload workflows.
- Keep E05-T08 paused unless explicitly reactivated.
- Bridge to the next community-access/moderation planning lane.

Why this is the highest-leverage next ticket:

The original Epoch 5 operator/admin tools, security closeout items, and
post-bootstrap operator grant management path are now documented and
runtime-proven or explicitly carried forward. Account signup confirmation and
work-email verification are already code-first, password reset remains
link-driven, and auth email branding/custom SMTP is deferred polish. The
highest-leverage next step is therefore checklist reconciliation; proof-upload
live mutation validation should not gate the current path.

Optional follow-ups after that ticket:

- Activate the manual auth email branding/custom SMTP plan later only if the
  user explicitly chooses to work on trust/deliverability polish.
- Begin the next non-Epoch-5 product lane only after the current roadmap says
  it is time.

## Not In Scope Yet

- Public launch readiness.
- Community boards, baseboards, rooms, posts, comments, or feeds.
- Community-admin tooling.
- Restricted-board gates or board memberships.
- Role/base/restricted-board claims.
- Employer-system lookup.
- Airline portal login.
- AI verification approval.
- Payments or marketplace features.
- New proof upload, badge upload, document upload, or proof review expansion.
- Proof cleanup expansion beyond the existing runtime-proven monitoring/manual
  controls.

## Safety Boundaries

- Keep operator/admin access explicit, database-backed, scoped, revocable, and
  audited.
- Keep reviewer scope separate from operator/admin access.
- Keep founder/admin internal access separate from airline-email eligibility.
- Keep beta invite-code behavior separate from airline-email eligibility and
  first-base launch access.
- Preserve historical audit rows and verification history.
- Do not expose raw proof files, proof contents, persistent proof locations,
  raw filenames, private identifiers, sensitive runtime values, or operational
  credentials in docs, UI, events, or responses.
- Do not run migrations, deploy, change DNS, change Vercel settings, change
  Supabase Auth settings, or mutate runtime state as part of level-set work.

## Level-Set Answers

1. Epoch 5 covers bounded operator/admin tooling for verification operations:
   operator access, admin shell/navigation, approved-domain management,
   reviewer-scope management, audit inspection, proof cleanup monitoring, and
   protected manual proof cleanup.
2. Implemented items include E05-T01 through E05-T07, operator grant management,
   founder/admin internal access, and adjacent beta invite-code operator
   generation.
3. Runtime-proven items include E05-T03 through E05-T07, operator grants
   bootstrap, post-bootstrap operator grant management, founder/admin internal
   access, beta invite-code foundation, and auth detour closeout.
4. Implemented but not dedicated-runtime-proven: no current core Epoch 5
   operator/admin capability remains in this category.
5. Missing entirely from Epoch 5: no current missing core E05-T01 through E05-T07
   capability; community-admin and board tooling are missing because they are
   later product lanes, not Epoch 5.
6. Temporary auth-detour artifacts relevant to Epoch 5 are the internal operator
   scope, `operator_internal` audit source, `/app/access-hold` status surface,
   and `jmpseat.com` cleanup documentation.
7. `jmpseat.com` temporary approved-domain cleanup is documented as closed in
   `docs/ops/auth-detour-closeout-runtime-pass.md`.
8. Highest-leverage next step is the documented private-beta-readiness bridge.
   Auth email branding/custom SMTP is now tracked as deferred
   trust/deliverability polish unless the user explicitly activates that ops
   task later. Proof uploads are deprecated/out of current scope unless a fresh
   scope decision and privacy/security review explicitly reactivate them.
