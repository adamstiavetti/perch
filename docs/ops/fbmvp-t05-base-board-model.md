# FBMVP-T05 Base Board Model

Date: 2026-06-09

Brand note: jmpseat is the canonical product and app name. This document does
not claim legal or trademark clearance for the name.

jmpseat is not affiliated with or endorsed by any airline, airport, union, or
employer unless explicitly obtained and documented.

## 1. Purpose

This note records the local implementation scope for `FBMVP-T05: Base, Board,
And Board-Type Data Model Design`.

T05 creates the database/model foundation for the First-Base MVP. It does not
build the app UI or later community interaction features.

## 2. Implemented Scope

T05 adds:

- `bases`
- `board_types`
- `boards`
- DFW as the first launch base
- DFW Base Board as the first available board
- board types for `base_board`, `layover_board`, and `verified_lounge`
- RLS enabled on all new tables
- indexes for expected base/board listing and lookup patterns

DFW is the first MVP launch base and first available base board. It is not the
whole product concept, and the schema supports many bases and boards from the
start.

## 3. Deferred Scope

The following remain later tickets:

- board follows
- home-base preferences
- verified lounge memberships
- board access requests
- community-admin grants
- posts
- comments/replies
- sharing
- saves
- reactions/useful marks
- search
- reports
- moderation/admin queues
- board intel/wiki structured content

Board wiki/intel is intentionally not a board type in T05. It should be modeled
as structured content attached to boards in a later ticket.

## 4. Authorization Notes

RLS is enabled on the new tables.

T05 keeps direct client policies conservative. The broad private-app eligibility
boundary remains enforced by existing server-side private app gates until later
community read helpers or route surfaces are implemented.

Self-declared `claimed_airline`, `claimed_role`, and `claimed_base` profile
fields must not become authorization truth. Airline-email verification grants
broad app eligibility only, not restricted-board membership.

## 5. Safety Notes

Proof uploads remain deprecated/out of current scope.

T05 does not touch proof upload code, proof storage, proof cleanup, or proof
review surfaces.

T05 does not create posts/comments, media uploads, user-generated content,
search, reports, or moderation workflows. Reporting/moderation/admin controls
remain required before broad real member-generated content exposure.
