## 1. Purpose

This note records the targeted Supabase runtime apply pass for
`FBMVP-T05: Base, Board, And Board-Type Data Model Design`.

T05 was already merged in app/repo history. This pass applies only the
database/model foundation migration to the intended `jmpseat` Supabase project
and verifies the seeded metadata state.

## 2. Runtime Apply Summary

Applied migration:

- `20260609020355 create_base_board_model`

Target Supabase project:

- `jmpseat`

Apply path used:

- authenticated Supabase connector

Why the connector path was used:

- the local CLI link path in this worktree lacked Supabase CLI auth
- the runtime pass stayed within the same intended project after explicit
  project confirmation

Broad `supabase db push` was not used.

Only `20260609020355` was recorded in remote migration history during this
pass.

## 3. Existing Drift Still Present

This pass did not resolve prior remote migration-history drift.

The existing documented drift remains:

- local `20260607103000` vs remote `20260607182257`
- local `20260607204212` vs remote `20260607205909`

That drift is why this pass remained targeted and did not use broad migration
push behavior.

## 4. Verification Results

Verified successfully:

- `public.bases` exists
- `public.board_types` exists
- `public.boards` exists
- row level security is enabled on all three tables
- `DFW` exists in `public.bases` with active status
- `base_board`, `layover_board`, and `verified_lounge` exist in
  `public.board_types`
- `DFW Base Board` exists in `public.boards`
- `DFW Base Board` uses slug `dfw`
- `DFW Base Board` has visibility `open_verified`
- `DFW Base Board` has posting mode `members_can_post`
- `DFW Base Board` has status `active`
- no unrelated migration versions were newly marked applied

## 5. Boundaries Preserved

This runtime pass did not:

- run broad `supabase db push`
- deploy app code
- change Vercel, DNS, SMTP, auth, storage, or runtime settings
- create posts, comments, memberships, follows, access requests, saves,
  reactions, search, reports, or moderation state
- touch proof-upload code, proof storage, proof cleanup, or proof review
  surfaces

The only runtime mutation in this pass was the intended T05 schema creation and
seeded metadata for:

- DFW as the first launch base
- the three controlled board types
- the first DFW Base Board row

## 6. Next Lane

The next implementation lane after the T05 runtime pass is:

- `FBMVP-T06: Home Base Preference + Board Follow Foundation`
