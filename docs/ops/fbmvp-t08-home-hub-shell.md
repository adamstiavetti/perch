# FBMVP-T08 Home Dashboard And DFW Hub Shell

## Purpose

`FBMVP-T08` adds the first read-only private-app Home Dashboard shell and DFW
Hub destination shell.

This is a web UI shell only. It does not add schema, migrations, deployment,
runtime Supabase mutation, dashboard mutations, posting, comments, saves,
search backend, lounge request/review flows, Crew Lead panel tooling, AI, or
seed content.

## Routes

Implemented routes:

- `/app`
- `/app/hubs/dfw`

Both routes preserve the existing private app gate and server-side security
event audit path.

`/app` becomes the read-only Home Dashboard shell after app-entry gates pass.
It uses the T06 Home Base helper only to read optional Home Base state. Missing
Home Base remains valid and does not block app entry.

`/app/hubs/dfw` is a read-only DFW Hub shell. It shows the intended Hub
surfaces without implementing their content or mutation behavior.

## Product-Facing Labels

Use the current product-facing taxonomy from
`docs/strategy/hub-board-taxonomy.md`:

- `Hub`
- `Baseboard`
- `Layovers`
- `Lounges`
- `Crew Picks`

The implementation may still use existing internal table names and board type
keys such as `base_board`, `layover_board`, and `verified_lounge`.

## Home Dashboard Shape

The Home Dashboard shell follows the product definition in
`docs/strategy/home-dashboard-product-definition.md`:

1. Search jmpseat
2. Home Base / Hub
3. Crew Picks
4. Following
5. Your Lounges
6. Saved

Search is a prominent retrieval affordance, not a full search implementation.

Crew Picks are described as saved-driven/admin-curated useful content, not
generic trending. Ranking is not implemented.

Following initially means followed boards. User follows are not implemented.

Your Lounges remains membership-gated future state. Request and review flows
are not implemented.

Saved remains a personal knowledge-library placeholder. Saves are not
implemented.

## Initial DFW-Only States

For users with DFW Home Base:

- show DFW Hub / Home Base card
- route the card to `/app/hubs/dfw`
- show DFW Baseboard as a followed-board placeholder
- state that Home Base is personalization only, not authorization truth

For users with no Home Base:

- show "Welcome to jmpseat"
- show "DFW Hub is live first"
- show a "Start with DFW" action after `FBMVP-T09`
- show a clear no-Home-Base state
- do not fake-assign DFW Home Base
- do not require an automatic board follow

The actual Start with DFW mutation path is implemented separately by
`FBMVP-T09` and recorded in `docs/ops/fbmvp-t09-start-with-dfw.md`. T08 itself
remains the read-only shell ticket.

## Safety Boundaries

T08 preserves these boundaries:

- Home Base does not grant lounge access.
- Board follows do not grant lounge access.
- Self-declared profile fields are not authorization truth.
- Work Email verification remains the broad app eligibility gate.
- Restricted lounge membership remains the future restricted-content access
  truth.
- No exact crew hotel exposure.
- No live crew location tracking.
- No passenger/private information.
- No airport security procedures.
- No operationally sensitive information.
- No proof uploads.

## Validation

Source/static tests cover:

- Home Dashboard hierarchy and labels
- DFW Hub shell taxonomy labels
- skip-for-now/no-Home-Base state
- private gate/audit preservation on the DFW Hub route
- no backend mutation scope
- no T08 migration
- no proof-upload scope

Full runtime validation remains pending until this branch is reviewed, merged,
deployed, and smoke-tested on the intended private beta surface.
