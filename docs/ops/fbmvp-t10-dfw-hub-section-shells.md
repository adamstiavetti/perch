## Purpose

`FBMVP-T10` gives the read-only DFW Hub section cards real private-app
destinations without implementing the underlying content systems yet.

This is a route-shell ticket only. It adds no schema, migrations, deployment,
runtime Supabase mutation, posting, comments, search backend, saves, reactions,
Crew Picks ranking, lounge request/review flows, Crew Lead panel, AI, seed
layover content, or proof-upload scope.

## Routes

New read-only routes:

- `/app/hubs/dfw/baseboard`
- `/app/hubs/dfw/layovers`
- `/app/hubs/dfw/lounges`
- `/app/hubs/dfw/crew-picks`

Each route:

- is dynamic/private
- uses the same private app gate and server-side security-event audit path as
  the DFW Hub shell
- links back to `/app/hubs/dfw`
- renders placeholder content only
- states what comes later
- avoids implying live posting, comments, search backend, saves, reactions,
  lounge request/review, Crew Lead panel, ranking, AI, or seeded content exists

The parent DFW Hub page now links its section cards to these routes.

## Section Definitions

### DFW Baseboard

Purpose:

- based-there community surface for DFW aviation workers
- base Q&A, updates, practical notes, and useful discussion

Placeholder boundaries:

- Recent discussions are coming later.
- Ask Baseboard is coming later.
- Community posting is not live yet.

### DFW Layovers

Purpose:

- crew layover utility for people passing through DFW
- food, coffee, gyms, transportation basics, quick recommendations, weather
  basics, and Q&A

Safety boundaries:

- no exact crew hotel locations
- no live crew tracking
- no security-sensitive or operationally sensitive information

Placeholder boundaries:

- Recommendations are coming later.
- Layover Q&A is coming later.
- Seeded destination strategy remains future work and is not implemented here.

The product/editorial definition for that future work is now locked in
`docs/strategy/seeded-layovers-editorial-model.md`.

The shared post/thread data foundation for future Baseboard and Layovers
content should land in `FBMVP-T12` before this shell grows into real posting or
seeded destination content.

### DFW Lounges

Purpose:

- restricted membership-based spaces associated with the DFW Hub
- managed by Crew Leads later

Access boundaries:

- Home Base does not grant lounge access.
- Board follows do not grant lounge access.
- Self-declared profile fields do not grant lounge access.
- Lounge request/review flow is not live yet.

Placeholder boundaries:

- Flight Attendants Lounge is coming later.
- Pilots Lounge is coming later.
- New Hires Lounge is coming later.
- Request access is coming later.

### DFW Crew Picks

Purpose:

- high-signal useful content curated by admins or saved-driven over time

Placeholder boundaries:

- Useful posts are coming later.
- Layover picks are coming later.
- Lounge-visible content remains access-aware later.
- No ranking or AI surfacing is live.

## Preserved Boundaries

T10 preserves these boundaries:

- no migrations
- no runtime data mutation
- no deployment
- no posting or comments
- no search backend
- no saves or reactions
- no Crew Picks ranking
- no lounge request/review flow
- no Crew Lead panel
- no AI
- no seed layover content
- no proof uploads
- no use of self-declared profile fields as authorization truth
- no Home Base or board-follow grant of lounge access

## Validation

Source/static tests cover:

- all four new route files exist
- all four routes are dynamic/private
- all four routes use the shared private gate/audit helper
- the parent DFW Hub shell links to the section routes
- product-facing labels exist for DFW Baseboard, DFW Layovers, DFW Lounges, and
  DFW Crew Picks
- Layovers safety copy exists
- lounge access boundaries remain explicit
- no migration is added
- no proof-upload scope is introduced

Runtime validation remains pending until this branch is reviewed, merged, and
tested on the intended private beta surface.
