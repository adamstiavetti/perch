# FBMVP-T26D Final Create Browser Smoke

Date: 2026-06-12

This record captures the final authenticated beta browser smoke attempt for the
`FBMVP-T26D` selected-channel create flow after the UUID validation fix.

This smoke is a partial/fail result, not a pass.

## Repo State During Smoke

- repo root: `/Users/ClawdBot/jmpseat-public-scroll`
- branch: `main`
- worktree: clean
- HEAD/origin: `bce510e`
- no files changed, staged, or committed during smoke

## Deployment Tested

Host reviewed:

- `https://beta.jmpseat.com`

Deployment readiness was confirmed before creating a post. The existing detail
route for `7f93f9a9-3dd1-4718-979a-2acc8194a999` rendered the prior safe smoke
post, proving the UUID validation fix from `dfbdc79` or newer was present.

## Smoke Post Created

Exactly one additional safe smoke post was created through the authenticated
browser UI.

Title:

- `DFW Q&A smoke test thread after UUID fix`

Body:

- `Post-fix smoke test for the DFW Channels composer. No operational, security-sensitive, passenger, hotel, or company-confidential information.`

Created post UUID:

- `8df32cc8-9254-4b43-8a37-102dc77739bd`

No additional post was created.

## Create Redirect Result

Failed / not passed.

Observed:

- the post was created
- after submit, the browser remained on
  `https://beta.jmpseat.com/app/hubs/dfw/channels/dfw-q-and-a`
- the browser did not redirect directly to
  `/app/hubs/dfw/channels/dfw-q-and-a/8df32cc8-9254-4b43-8a37-102dc77739bd`
- no raw error leaked
- no `dfw_channel_post_failed` query parameter appeared

## Post Detail Result

Passed.

Direct detail route rendered the newly created post:

- `https://beta.jmpseat.com/app/hubs/dfw/channels/dfw-q-and-a/8df32cc8-9254-4b43-8a37-102dc77739bd`

Verified:

- title rendered
- body rendered
- channel breadcrumb/name rendered
- safe author label rendered
- safe metadata rendered
- unavailable state did not render
- no visible UUID/internal IDs in page text

## Thread List Result

Passed.

Selected-channel route:

- `https://beta.jmpseat.com/app/hubs/dfw/channels/dfw-q-and-a`

Verified:

- new post appeared in thread list exactly once
- previous smoke post still appeared
- new row linked to
  `/app/hubs/dfw/channels/dfw-q-and-a/8df32cc8-9254-4b43-8a37-102dc77739bd`
- clicking the new row ultimately rendered the new detail route
- no duplicate post was created from the single submit

## No-Cookie / Public-Domain Boundaries

Passed.

No-cookie beta:

- selected-channel route returned `307` to login with `next`
- new detail route returned `307` to login with `next`

Public-domain checks:

- public `jmpseat.com` canonicalized to `www.jmpseat.com`
- public selected-channel route redirected to `/`
- public detail route redirected to `/`
- private app routes were not exposed on public domain

## Product Boundary Checks

The T26D composer was present on the selected-channel page, as expected.

No functional surfaces appeared for:

- comments/replies UI
- report controls
- moderation controls
- Request a Channel workflow
- fake activity counts
- fake thread counts
- DFW Today/Base/Layover functionality
- private-app user-facing `Baseboard` label

Explanatory copy that comments/reports are later scoped tickets is acceptable
because no functional comments/reports surface was present.

## Security / Privacy Checks

No visible exposure of:

- board IDs
- base IDs
- parent board IDs
- author user IDs
- reporter identity
- verification/proof data
- storage paths
- signed URLs
- runtime comments/reports
- passenger private information
- exact crew hotel exposure
- airport/security-sensitive procedures
- company-confidential content
- live crew movement/location

## Optional Runtime Verification

Read-only SQL found one matching published/board-visible post for the new smoke
title:

- channel slug: `dfw-q-and-a`
- channel name: `DFW Q&A`
- post UUID: `8df32cc8-9254-4b43-8a37-102dc77739bd`
- title: `DFW Q&A smoke test thread after UUID fix`
- status/visibility: `published` / `board`

No runtime data was mutated beyond the one authorized UI-created smoke post.
Internal board/base/author IDs are not included in this record.

## Ticket Status

T26D browser create status:

- partial / failed on redirect
- create mutation and post insertion succeeded
- downstream list/detail reads work
- browser create flow still did not redirect to created post detail after submit

T26B regression:

- passed because the thread list shows the new child-channel post

T26C regression:

- passed because the detail route renders the new valid UUID post

## Unexpected Findings

- UUID validation fix resolved detail rendering for valid child-channel post
  UUIDs.
- UUID validation fix did not fully resolve T26D create redirect behavior.
- Likely follow-up area: post-submit navigation/redirect handling in create
  action/client form handling.

No more smoke posts should be created until this redirect behavior is
investigated.

## Remaining Work

Next implementation work should investigate the post-submit navigation/redirect
handling that leaves the browser on the selected-channel page after a successful
create.

No new runtime migration is needed based on this smoke result unless later
investigation proves otherwise.

UI/UX polish remains deferred.

## Documentation Governance Status

Docs updated:

- `docs/ops/fbmvp-t26d-final-create-browser-smoke.md`
- `docs/BUILD_TICKETS.md`
- `docs/ops/05b-first-base-mvp-planning.md`
- `docs/ops/fbmvp-remaining-functional-backlog.md`
- `docs/ops/fbmvp-t26d-channel-composer-create-foundation.md`
- `docs/ops/fbmvp-t26d-channel-composer-browser-smoke.md`
- `docs/ops/fbmvp-t26d-channel-composer-uuid-validation-fix.md`
- `docs/ops/fbmvp-t26d-t26c-post-fix-browser-smoke.md`
- `docs/ops/fbmvp-t26c-channel-post-detail-browser-smoke.md`

Docs not updated / why:

- Broad roadmap docs were not updated because this is a focused browser-smoke
  status record, not a roadmap or MVP-boundary change.
- Runtime-apply docs were not updated because no runtime migration or SQL apply
  was needed.
- App, migration, and test files were not updated because this task only records
  browser-smoke results.

Scope impact:

- Browser-smoke documentation only.
- No app behavior, migrations, tests, runtime data beyond the already-authorized
  smoke post, deployment settings, or Supabase schema changed in this docs task.

Runtime apply docs needed?

- No.

Browser smoke docs needed?

- Satisfied by this record for the final T26D create-browser redirect attempt.
- The result is partial/fail; follow-up defect investigation is required before
  T26D can be considered fully closed.
