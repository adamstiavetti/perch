# Proof Upload Content Validation Fix

Date: 2026-06-08

## Current Status

Proof uploads are deprecated and out of current scope for the active private
beta / 05B product path. Current verification direction should prioritize
work-email verification, private beta access gates, and the proof-system
freeze/deprecation plan.

This document remains the historical security record for the proof-upload
hardening that was already implemented. If proof-upload code, private storage,
or historical proof artifacts still exist, they remain subject to the privacy,
authorization, retention, cleanup, and audit controls documented here and in
the related proof-retention/proof-access docs.

The old safe live authenticated proof-upload mutation test is no longer an
active next task, release blocker, or prerequisite before 05B. Any future
manual-proof, badge-upload, document-upload, or proof-upload workflow would
require a fresh scope decision plus privacy/security review before activation.

## Summary

This patch hardens redacted proof upload validation so the server no longer
trusts browser-controlled MIME metadata or filename extensions alone.

The prior upload path accepted `File.type` and the filename extension as the
source of truth, then stored the uploaded bytes in the private proof bucket with
that client-provided image content type. A normal authenticated user could label
HTML, SVG, PDF, ZIP, or random bytes as JPEG/PNG and store them as proof
objects. That did not prove script execution or account compromise, but it did
allow unexpected non-image bytes into a sensitive reviewer-facing storage flow.

## Fix

Redacted proof upload validation now requires all three signals to agree before
Storage upload:

- allowed browser MIME value: `image/jpeg` or `image/png`
- allowed filename extension: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`
- server-side byte validation of real JPEG or PNG structure

The server rejects:

- HTML labeled as PNG/JPEG
- SVG labeled as PNG/JPEG
- PDF labeled as PNG/JPEG
- ZIP or random bytes labeled as PNG/JPEG
- MIME/content/extension mismatches
- empty or truncated image-like files
- files over the existing size cap

Rejected files receive the safe user-facing error:

`Upload a real PNG or JPEG image.`

The action still enforces redaction acknowledgement before upload and keeps the
existing 5 MB cap.

## Decode/Re-Encode Decision

This patch does not add server-side decode/re-encode. The current runtime does
not already include an image decoding pipeline, and adding a heavy native image
dependency would require separate deployment compatibility review.

Instead, the patch uses bounded structural validation:

- PNG validation checks the PNG signature, required chunk order, `IHDR`, nonzero
  dimensions, supported image fields, nonempty `IDAT`, and terminal `IEND`.
- JPEG validation checks SOI/EOI markers, segment bounds, a valid start-of-frame
  segment with nonzero dimensions, and a start-of-scan segment.

This is a server-side content gate and materially improves reviewer safety
without changing product scope or storage policy.

## Storage Behavior

Storage remains private and unchanged:

- bucket: `verification-proofs`
- UUID-only randomized storage paths
- no public URLs
- no signed URLs during upload
- no proof filename/path/content in user-visible errors or security-event
  metadata

Storage `contentType` is set from the server-detected safe validation result,
not directly from `File.type`.

## Reviewer Access

Reviewer access behavior is unchanged:

- reviewer-scope checks remain required
- request/evidence matching remains required
- self-review remains blocked
- only reviewable statuses can be viewed
- signed URLs remain short-lived and server-minted only after authorization
- proof-view audit logging remains in place

This patch only reduces what can enter the private proof bucket.

## Boundaries Preserved

This patch does not change:

- public waitlist behavior
- waitlist database behavior
- private-app operator scope gate behavior
- security-events trust-boundary behavior
- proof bucket privacy
- reviewer authorization
- signed URL TTLs
- proof cleanup behavior
- beta grants
- operator grants
- role claims
- base claims
- restricted-board claims
- private beta auth settings

No proof files or runtime data were accessed or mutated.

## Validation Status

Regression coverage proves:

- valid minimal PNG bytes are accepted
- valid minimal JPEG bytes are accepted
- fake PNG/JPEG metadata with HTML bytes is rejected
- SVG, PDF, ZIP, random bytes, and truncated image-like bytes are rejected
- MIME/content/extension mismatches are rejected
- accepted upload metadata and Storage content type use the safe validation
  result
- existing redaction acknowledgement, file size, storage path, metadata,
  rollback, and reviewer signed-URL authorization tests still pass

## Runtime Pass

Runtime deployment validation was completed on 2026-06-08 after merge to
`main`.

Deployed commit:

- `329d238 fix: validate proof upload image content`

Deployment and domain behavior:

- `https://jmpseat.com` was explicitly aliased to the new production deployment.
- `https://www.jmpseat.com` was explicitly aliased to the same production
  deployment.
- `https://beta.jmpseat.com` was explicitly aliased to a separate preview
  deployment for the private beta/auth/admin surface.
- No DNS changes were made.
- No Supabase settings were changed.
- No migration was created or applied.
- No proof bucket policy, privacy, reviewer authorization, signed URL TTL,
  self-review block, reviewable status check, or proof audit logging behavior
  was weakened.

Beta/private runtime smoke:

- `https://beta.jmpseat.com/login` rendered successfully.
- Signed-out `https://beta.jmpseat.com/app` redirected to beta login.
- Signed-out `https://beta.jmpseat.com/app/admin/waitlist` redirected to beta
  login.
- No beta grants, operator grants, role claims, base claims, restricted-board
  claims, or private beta auth settings were changed.

Public preservation smoke:

- `https://jmpseat.com/` and `https://jmpseat.com/#top` loaded at `scrollY: 0`.
- `https://www.jmpseat.com/` and `https://www.jmpseat.com/#top` loaded at
  `scrollY: 0`.
- Apex and `www` still render the public waitlist form.
- Public pages still do not expose Beta Access, `/login?next=/app`, proof
  upload, badge upload, document upload, or manual-review upload copy.
- Privacy and Terms pages returned successfully on apex and `www`.
- No raw email or token appeared in the checked public URLs.

Live proof-upload mutation:

- Not performed in this pass and now deprecated as an active follow-up for the
  current product path.
- Reason: no safe authenticated proof-upload test workflow/account was
  available in this run, and forcing a live mutation would risk creating proof
  rows or private Storage objects without a controlled cleanup path.
- No proof files, proof rows, or proof Storage objects were accessed, created,
  viewed, or deleted.

Closure status:

- Code-level and deployed-route validation are complete.
- The metadata-spoof hardening remains historically documented.
- The former future live mutation test is not required before 05B and should
  not be treated as an active security-closeout blocker while proof uploads are
  out of current product scope.
- If a future scope decision reactivates proof upload, new validation should
  verify valid PNG/JPEG acceptance, fake-image rejection before Storage upload,
  safe generic error copy, and cleanup of any controlled test artifacts with
  sensitive details redacted.

This finding no longer blocks the current private beta / 05B planning lane.
